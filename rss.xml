The teams can either be Design, Frontend, Backend, Strategy, Product(ofcourse!) or follow the squad way (if that is what your company follows) and have all the team leads in there. I don’t suggest the latter if you have too many teams in your organization, since more people means more time &amp;amp; more confusion. However you know what works best for your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally the design sprint is a 5 day process with 5 stages, Concentrating on various things everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, product sprint will only have 3 steps &amp;amp; can be done within 1 day/8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is what happens in it -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Understand/Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will ask the strategists (usually the founders/ CPO/ PO) what their immediate one year vision is (they will talk about what they would like to achieve &amp;amp; the challenges these goals face for 5 minutes). While they discuss, all other members can interview them further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example - If the founder says - We should grow our sales by 40% this quarter. He/She might get asked - HOW MIGHT WE scale our resources to do this? HOW MIGHT WE(HMW) support the sales team feature wise to achieve this? These questions shall also be written down. Once done, we will begin putting up all these questions on a wall, you will begin to see that most HMWs follow some pattern &amp;amp; all the varied questions are actually leading to a bigger question, that will now form the theme of the following discussion. We will now map out an ideal solution that will help achieve this common goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Microscopic target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a target, we will go around the room (this time strategists don’t participate) as to how we can achieve this target with their function’s help or why we haven’t achieved it yet. We do one more round of this where they tell us how we can achieve this target with the help of some other function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: Engg. lead says we can achieve this by reducing our latency and in the second round he says we can achieve this if the product team builds better product analytics that help understand what customer needs. You will hopefully see a common enough pattern to what needs our attention right away. Clarity should be achieved at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. Clarity extended&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will now go back with these insights, look at data + customer insights and derive some patterns around this. We can now decide what needs to be built and how/ what timelines etc. This step involves not everyone but product team alone to figure out the future roadmaps and such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When should you do this?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priorities for each team are different &amp;amp; everyone’s thinking might need some alignment. Especially in what you should focus as a company. Even if both of you have a clear understanding, it will help conveying to the team &amp;amp; getting them onboard easily. This will also help in teams being able to converge &amp;amp; understand why something needs to be worked on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you do this ?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that there’s a pandemic going on and most of the product teams are working remotely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are the three essential tools for your remote sprint. First, video conferencing to keep everyone in sync during group activities. Second, a virtual whiteboard app that will become your shared brain for the sprint. And third, a team discussion board for communication throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about how to handle a remote sprint session &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Designing Customer Support Experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Background The product we were working on was a visual AI and AR-powered tool to assist users in problem identification, and specifically…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/Designing-customer-support-experience/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/Designing-customer-support-experience/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product we were working on was a visual AI and AR-powered tool to assist users in problem identification, and specifically the task in hand was to improve the experience of Customer Support Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Customer Delight(CD) team deals with the customer complaints and operational issues on a daily basis. As we were getting more clients, it soon became clear that we needed to improve our Customer Support Center channel to deal with the number of customer enquiries/day. There was a clear need to implement strategies to educate the customers to deal with their pain points by new methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pain points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limited FAQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No central location to house FAQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No way for users to raise tickets/enquiries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Problem statement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing FAQ is outdated. As the number of our users grow, there was a need to have an  informative Help Centre that manages FAQ as well as enquiry tickets, which doesn’t exist currently. The goal is to reduce the number of tickets in General Enquiry, so CD Team can focus on solving more complex, technical issues, e.g. account inaccessible etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;UX Mood board&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started with a UX mood board to look at some help centres of the world’s most user-centric, visually powered companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common themes are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prominent search bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categorised FAQ topics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick links to popular topics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further help channels at the bottom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAQ topics presented in layman terms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instructions are broken down into direct short points that are easy to follow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screengrabs/Short videos to explain solutions visually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Design process&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working closely with the Tech Team, I collated the new FAQ content and created the IA for the Help Centre as well as the enquiry ticket submission flows. Since this was the first time we were setting this up, we wanted to get into the minds of our users and think of all scenarios where an issue may rise, so we ran a “Design Thinking” exercise to proceed with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created a laundry-list of items to create content on and then classified it as L1  (Needed, common issue) and L2 (Needed, not a common issue).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L1 items consisted of -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“As a presenter, how do I..”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic Features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach to UI designing was to support and articulate the content in the best possible manner. For providing the most efficiency, personalisation was brought into picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a signed-out default content also articulated, majorly FAQs and a rounded idea of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps involved working with developers to test it out for internal user-testing of inital design, and to finally roll it out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create a NFT marketplace]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week, WazirX launched South Asia’s ﬁrst non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace with 15 creators hailing from multiple categories…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-to-create-a-NFT-marketplace/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-to-create-a-NFT-marketplace/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last week, WazirX launched South Asia’s ﬁrst non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace with 15 creators hailing from multiple categories including digital artists, muralist photographers, canvas artists, space 3D artists, street artists, and visual artists to sell their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview of the NFT marketplace domain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NFT marketplace is a dedicated platform for storing and trading non-fungible tokens.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obligations of parties are represented in smart contacts in the form of if/then. For example, if a buyer transfers the payment for a digital item, then a seller grants the right to this NFT crypto asset. Provided that the condition is met, the smart contract conducts the transaction independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible tokens are implemented via smart contracts. Each item comes with unique metadata. This set of specific information related to supply, provenance, and authenticity is written in smart contracts. Blockchain technology carefully protects this data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For token marketplace development, we need to create a token protocol. As a rule, these protocols are created on the Ethereum network, which is a particular group of smart contracts. They enable the implementation of certain marketplace functionality. Later on, token protocols will be integrated in the process of NFT marketplace development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s discuss how NFT marketplaces work for users. Here we should say that the flow is similar for all non-fungible auction websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt; Users register an account on an NFT platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt; Setting a crypto wallet is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt; Here comes the NFT creation process. For this purpose, users upload digital items to showcase their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt; Users list items for sale. Here they have two options: choosing a bid for an auction or setting a fixed price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt; Items pass moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6&lt;/strong&gt; As soon as new NFTs are approved, potential buyers can see it in the list for sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7&lt;/strong&gt; The tokens’ owner can start accepting bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8&lt;/strong&gt; When the auction closes, sellers are notified about top bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9&lt;/strong&gt; The NFT platform regulates the transfer of digital assets and funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What features should you offer in an NFT marketplace website or an app&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What functionality for your crypto marketplace should you implement in the first place? Your primary task is to allow users to create and sell collectibles. Then, extra features can be added to offer website visitors an excellent user experience. An NFT marketplace website or app should offer the following features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An eCommerce storefront;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search functions, including the advanced ones;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Various filters while searching;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The creation of product listing;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Displaying the status of the product listing;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The buying functionality including features like the shopping cart, checkout, etc.;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The auctioning functionality;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with popular digital wallets;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The payment functionality including the integration with payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, etc.;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synchronization of the offline activities;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product rating capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the business part, it remains the same as for any other software product. You need to define the right audience for your platform and the challenges you are going to solve with its help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Decide on the business model and project scope of your proposed NFT marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onboard a team that includes a competent project manager (PM), an experienced software architect, and a few smart business analysts (BAs). This team needs to determine the marketplace business model. It should document the scope of the project, furthermore, it needs to decide on the best approach to execute the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might involve various questions, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who are your target audiences?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your key value proposition?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you want to operate a multi-vendor marketplace?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you want to operate as an aggregator as Uber does in the cab-hailing space?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the different pricing mechanisms that you want to use?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will you charge a listing fee?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which characteristics of the sharing economy do you plan to use?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having an understanding on the key features of non-fungible token platform, and the functioning you want it to have, next step is to move ahead with the development process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hunting for the big ideas]]></title><description><![CDATA[An idea is born somewhere relatively obscure (maybe in a garage somewhere), spreads to small communities of hardcore enthusiasts (like…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/hunting-for-the-big-ideas/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/hunting-for-the-big-ideas/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An idea is born somewhere relatively obscure (maybe in a garage somewhere), spreads to small communities of hardcore enthusiasts (like Kickstarter and Reddit), and sometime later takes the mainstream by surprise when it suddenly explodes into popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey is familiar in the context of startups, but it applies to important ideas and technologies more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is bitcoin, which began as an interesting whitepaper published in 2008 that was circulated among cryptography experts for a few years before coming to the attention of the mainstream startup community. Now, it’s a cryptocurrency  — and blockchain protocol  — sensation where activity is being tracked closely and community splits are being chronicled by newspapers around the world &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to catch these ideas as they emerge, in their very early stages?It’s difficult, because the places where these sleeper trends begin are seemingly random and obscure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHERE NEW IDEAS ‘COME FROM’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting these ideas has an element of serendipity and luck to it, but there are some things we can all do to improve our chances of finding an important trend before it hits the mainstream. The techniques aren’t different from what media and marketing “coolhunters” or trendspotters do to find pop culture trends early: It’s one part looking in the right places and cultivating the right sources, and one part noticing anomalies and acting quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The places where sleeper trends begin are by definition unpredictable, so it’s important to cast a broad net among interesting discussion groups or hobbyist communities  — virtual or physical  —  that seem like good incubators for new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to keep track of what these groups are doing by setting up streams of information about them  —  anything from subscribing to newsletters and discovering good blogs in that space, to attending meetups and conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to stay informed is by building a network of “social gateways”, people who are well connected in the communities you want to watch but that are also far enough outside your usual network that you are hearing about new things. Then, when a particularly compelling idea surfaces, you will hear about it early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some communities are far more likely to produce winning ideas than others. In his classic work &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations&quot;&gt;The Diffusion of Innovations&lt;/a&gt;, sociologist Everett Rogers describes the characteristics of so-called “early adopters” – people who are more likely to find and use new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people are usually open-minded and scientific in their mindset, and have time or money to spend on trying new things. Any group with these characteristics is a good place for technologies to germinate, which is perhaps why college campuses make great testbeds for not only spotting but trying out new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best groups of early adopters are extroverted and have lots of social ties, because the more connected they are, the faster new ideas spread through the group. This is why trends often start with young people in cities, rather than in sprawling suburban neighborhoods, even though the latter group may be just as willing to try out the same new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly connected groups can be either offline (densely populated cities or other clusters) or online (tight-knit online communities). A really good sign of such a highly connected group is one that has a newly formed, makeshift online presence, like a dedicated Slack channel or fast-growing subreddit (r/nameofgrouportopic). That usually means the group is both new and highly connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of small groups where ideas could surface is too large to watch them all, so it may be preferable to look further along the path, where ideas collect  —  in communities that aren’t very big, but have outsized importance or influence. The places to watch aren’t so much “gatekeepers” or curators of culture, like influential editors, as they are tastemakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SPOTTING AN IMPORTANT TREND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:554px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of a new idea, it’s often the case that nobody is paying for anything. One way of guessing at economic impact, is by looking at “proxy for demand”  —  how much people will pay for similar alternatives  —  and on the other side, looking at “proxy for supply” – how expensive something was to produce before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s still tricky, because it’s so hard to estimate the economic changes brought by a disruptive technology. It can be dangerous to dismiss or embrace trends solely for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while rapid exponential growth is a good sign, it’s not everything. Internet memes have huge growth as well. Most ideas that quickly attract a large audience are actually just fads, and it’s important to be able to pick out the important ones. One good sign is evidence of a “secret”, or some plausible reasoning why this idea couldn’t have manifested itself before now. With bitcoin, the secret is the technical breakthrough described in the bitcoin paper; where previous efforts at distributed trust and decentralized resourcing failed, it coupled bitcoin (incentives) with the blockchain protocol (distributed ledger) to solve those problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;GOING MAINSTREAM&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a breakthrough or a community of early adopters clearly isn’t enough. So how does one tell a trend  —  something that continues to spread  — from a fad  —  something that flares briefly and dies? The key is it needs to spread beyond the group of early adopters to the rest of the world, and there needs to be a real pathway for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the internet, this path was from metropolitan centers, through the suburbs to the rest of the population. For ideas that spread purely online, the path could be through a big aggregator site like Reddit. Another pattern is spread by institutional similarity: Facebook was able to easily spread from Harvard to clusters of students in other schools, because of the structural similarity of most universities to each other despite other differences they may have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another path is by latching on to a different fast-growing community. In the 1990s, one of the big marketing successes of Sprite was advertising to the hip-hop subculture before it became mainstream. This type of path is especially important in technology, as subcultures that go through massive exponential growth are common. Targeting fast-growing communities is a common strategy for startups who want to see their user base grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaming has been a good example of an underrated community for the last few years  —  despite little prestige, it’s a surprisingly large and influential subculture, and gamers have been early adopters of ideas like livestreaming and VR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while in an ideal world, futurists could rationally deduce what the next big trend will be- , the reality is that these systems are complex and more fluid, change compounds and build on each other, and there are lots of unknown unknowns to account for.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[NFTs - What are they.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise in popularity of Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) that happened this year, I decided to research and make this extensive guide in order to introduce this new growing market to those who may not be familiar with it, with that said let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly is a Non-Fungible Token or NFT?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique, individual token existing on a blockchain such as Ethereum. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, each NFT token contains unique data meaning non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable with each other. This makes the greatly different from their fungible counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example here is a dollar - if you and I both have a dollar - we can swap dollars and it wouldn’t matter, neither of us lose/win, i.e., they are equal. Whereas, with NFTs, these are unique tokens, meaning if we both have an NFT, mine could be a Pokemon trading card and yours could be your birth certificate- obviously we cannot exchange these two &amp;gt;equally. Therefore making our tokens non-fungible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A little bit of history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs are a thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Andrew.Steinwold/the-history-of-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-f362ca57ae10&quot;&gt;since 2012&lt;/a&gt;, developers experimented with the technology over the years but the first projects that got exposure and found their way to the mainstream were CryptoKitties (you could adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats) and CryptoPunks (you could bought unique digital characters), since then there was a big progress in the NFTs space and lately you hear about it on every crypto related place and even on art and music magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775&quot;&gt;most expensive CryptoKitty&lt;/a&gt; today priced 600 ETH (~ 1.1mn USD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

You cannot make another NFT that is the same token number on the same smart contract. Meaning there will only ever be one of that token. This is verified by the blockchain and can be seen by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare&lt;/strong&gt; - Since they are unique and cannot be copied, they are rare. Most of the time, there are very few NFTs from an artist or seller - very rarely do they have 1000s of NFTs. Therefore, you can safely assume you would be one of the few people in the world that owns a collectible item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collectible&lt;/strong&gt; - These NFTs/items are collectibles. You can hold onto them, and their value will only go up in price since there are little ways to dilute the collection. Buying them to resell them can earn you thousands of dollars. There are plenty of people who do it everyday and earn a living from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forever&lt;/strong&gt; - NFTs are forever. Because the data doesn’t change, and because the blockchain is forever, you will always have that token if you buy it. You can always resell that token if you want. It’s like buying a bar of gold - you own it, and you can do with it what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resellable&lt;/strong&gt; - You can always resell your NFT. You SHOULD resell your NFT and trade it. You can make some serious cash trading NFTs. Some NFTs have gone for 20,000 USD + when the original buyer only bought it for a few thousand dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable&lt;/strong&gt; - No one can change the metadata on the token, no one can remove your image, or the name of the token, etc. This means it will never change, it will never be removed, it cannot be taken down off the blockchain. This is what gives it so much value and collectibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s special about NFTs and why they can change industries like music or art?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the buyers, NFTs provide a secure certificate of ownership over the asset it represents, protecting its value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sellers, NFTs make it not only possible to sell something today, but also to keep earning in the future. Artists in particular have struggled to earn rewards if their work appreciates in value. NFTs can be coded to allow the original creator to collect money each time the token moves hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items. This has initially proven popular for blockchain games and collectibles like CryptoKitties on the Ethereum blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artwork is another example of how powerful NFTs can be. By allowing artists to create artwork on the blockchain as NFTs, it means their content now becomes sellable globally, on decentralized marketplaces. Providing a means to collect, earn, and make a living off crypto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs are valuable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I get started with Buying/Trading NFTs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt; : You need ETH and an ethereum wallet to get started. The most common is &lt;a href=&quot;https://metamask.io/&quot;&gt;Metamask.io&lt;/a&gt; - then you add some ETH into that wallet. This is required by all sites in order to interact with an Ethereum application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt; : Find a marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top NFT marketplaces are currently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mintable.app/&quot;&gt;Mintable.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/c6f9675a5565a12c818b873bfbc2c781/s86.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Mintable&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensea.io/&quot;&gt;Opensea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://superrare.co/&quot;&gt;SuperRare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rarible.com/&quot;&gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more NFT marketplaces but these are the leading open marketplaces, others may not be open to all NFTs and only select items&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these let you create your own NFTs (if you’re a creator) and some of them are closed like SuperRare, where only approved artists can create items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why are NFTs so expensive?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any asset or coin, supply and demand are driving the price. Due to the scarce nature of NFTs and the high demand for them people are often prepared to pay a lot of money for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, a lot of people see those NFTs as an investment opportunity, they can resell the NFT they bought for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do I get started minting NFTs?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, we will take an example of any marketplace to look at the costs involved and options available. Of course, you are free to research  If you are a content creator, whether its artwork, graphic designs, 3D models, videos, PDF, research - it can all be turned into an NFT using platforms like Mintable.app. Mintable is the most flexible and has the most possibilities so we will be using it and discussing how you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: there are plenty of places to make NFTs, but they either are: more expensive, have file size limits below 50mb, don’t let you control your contracts, or do not offer decentralization.
Minting on Mintable.app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Mintable you can sign up for an account and then it’s free to start Minting NFTs. You have three options to select from when you choose to mint:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your own store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mint in Mintables store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gasless minting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your own store:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you create your own store, you are making a smart contract on the blockchain - that you own, you control, your the only person who owns it. This is the preferred method for creating NFTs but there is one single downside…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying a smart contract COSTS a ton if gas prices are above 50 gwei. Around $100 initial investment to deploy the smart contract - but after that, you can mint hundreds of NFTs for as little as $10 using Mintable’s batch minting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think of it as an ‘operational cost’ to get an online business going, $100 isn’t that bad. But if you’re struggling to pay that - then you can mint under Mintable’s store, where everyone shares the contract and can mint NFTs (that still are owned by you!) but don’t need to worry about deploying your own store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mintable’s Store&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You save on transaction fees when you use Mintable’s store as you don’t need to pay the initial overhead of deploying your own store to the blockchain. Everyone can use Mintable’s store for free, and can mint thousands of NFTs in a single transaction doing so. This is one of the reasons Mintable.app is the most flexible platform for creating NFTs, no where else can you make so many NFTs for so cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gasless Minting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are able to mint directly on Mintable’s store without needing to submit a single transaction, meaning no transaction fees from the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the best way to get started. You can do it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mintable.app/gasless&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minting the NFT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve decided what store your NFT will be minted on - the next step is actually Minting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of possibilities when minting on mintable, so here is a more in depth breakdown of everything that is happening Creating an item&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you click sell - you will be taken to a page to create your listing for your NFT and then mint it on the blockchain. It’s very similar to listing an item for sale on ebay, etsy, or amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can create your title, the subtitle, add a description (make it good and tell a story behind your NFT!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The part that sucks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The NFT may unlock some functionality, features, etc. when connected to some external system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if the CryptoKitties site/etc. goes down, your CryptoKitty tokens are now meaningless/function-less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your NFT is basically just a trade-able serial number that represents a ‘Moment’ or ‘CryptoKitty’ on their servers, and allows you to interact with said ‘Moment’ or ‘Kitty’ via their application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The creator of some media (or physical thing) may sell legal rights to the media along with the sale of an NFT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this one gets problematic, fast, and is where many people are getting scammed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee the user you are buying the NFT from actually owns rights to the thing represented/linked to by the NFT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if someone screenshots someone’s art, and uploads it to make a new NTF but no one knows you are doing this until you have sold 50 and cashed out into fiat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have two entries of the same item, then I am guessing the one to log in the item first gets to own the rights to the collectible. Take Sir Isaac Newton for example, in many circles it is believed that people had discovered the law of gravity long before him. However, Sir Isaac Newton was the first to publish it comprehensively enough to make it his own discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in order to legally transfer rights/ownership/etc. you must put it on paper/document it. (And for larger items like a house or business, this requires significant legal information in the documentation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means, is that if you want to buy ‘ownership’ of some linked asset via its NFT, you have to do your own diligence to ensure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are the current copyright owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are consenting, in writing, to selling the rights to you with/via the NFT, and included whatever legal documentation is necessary, if any additional is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point you can guarantee you’ve at least bought ownership rights of the thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s no reason you can’t simply sell those ownership rights independent of the NFT in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;there is nothing legally tying NFTs to digital rights ownership at present.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How you are going to get scammed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/0e70a3509af4446037a9b93e9509b99e/s82.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cons of NFT&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying an NFT for ‘ownership’ of a thing when the seller doesn’t own the thing to start with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying an NFT for ‘ownership’ of the thing without ever actually getting it in writing/legally enforceable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying an NFT for ‘ownership’ of the thing and getting non-exclusive rights (instead of exclusive rights to the thing), meaning the author can continue to mint infinite more NFTs of exactly the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying a ‘collectible’ NFT and the collectible site/host/system goes under/pulls the rug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying an NFT for ‘investment’, only for that NFT to have an exorbitant (50-100%) royalty fee. Meaning most or all of the proceeds of your investment go to the creator, instead of you, when you re-sell the NFT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying NFT art/etc. and having the url host of the digital media go down, (or they maliciously change it) so your NFT no longer shows what you bought. ( But at least you still have ownership rights if you didn’t get burned on #1/#2 … )&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The part that’s good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs have big potential for game item marketplaces as the company can issue their items with some royalty rate (ex. 1%), and always get a cut of sales if their game (and trade of its items) takes off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs can also make for good ‘proof of attendance’/historical proof type tokens, which is to say, you could be given one for attending a concert as proof you were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, NFTs are perfect for digital ticket sales. They can’t directly be copied/cloned, and even if they’re resold on a secondary market, you will get a cut of it. (At least, as long as the scalpers play within the system, and don’t, say, just sell the ETH address that owns the token, or take cash as payment then transfer the token for ‘free’.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as ownership of real unbound digital assets, or physical objects, there is certainly interesting potential there, but right now, they’re legally useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting there’s a little more nuance into interesting things NFTs can do in terms of smart-contract-esque stuff that’s a little too technical for this post, but might show up in future use cases for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, as mentioned earlier, NFTs can be great for artists. NFTs are one of the best ways to actually earn crypto over time, without needing to invest in it directly. (unlike scams that say the same thing, NFTs are legit. It’s like opening a store on ebay or etsy, trading your time and work for money).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs can return the power and control back into the hands of the artists!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah, they’re also great for money laundering, since if you’re buying some nonsense collectable picture of a hat on the internet, it’s impossible to say you ‘overpayed’, so that’s a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra links :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/#Whats_next_for_NFTs_Our_2020_predictions&quot;&gt;NFT Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/&quot;&gt;NFT Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Being part of a startup accelerator]]></title><description><![CDATA[Startup accelerators - What are they ?

They run fixed-term, cohort-based programs for the most promising startups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is to quickly equip companies with everything they need to scale. This includes providing seminars, investor pitches, and help fine-tuning the product and business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for a short (3-6 month) program and chunk of startup capital, accelerators often take a slice of equity, usually ranging from 5% to 10%. Others don’t take equity or may provide less initial capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of capital or the intensity of the program is often seen as a differentiator between accelerator programs and incubators. Incubators are geared to help very early stage startups, often in an idea or testing phase; maybe getting their first few clients. Whereas an accelerator provides the resources to help that small startup grow into one which has proof-of-concept, market validation, and an understanding of what it should do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Which areas get the most funding?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’ll come as no surprise that all 11 of the highest-growth verticals (by funding) are technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2017, robotics, blockchain and agtech each grew by over 1,000%. The next biggest three verticals were AI, fintech, and cybersecurity.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack is pretty popular these days, so I’m not going to spend loads of time on its basic features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #1: The best remote workflow app&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you have a million tabs, browsers, PDFs, and whatever else cluttering your desktop. The last thing you need is another app taking up space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Slack desktop app sits nice and discreetly in your taskbar. You get to keep some of the clutter out of your browser tabs, and have one less thing to juggle. It’s there when you need it; out of the way when you don’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mobile app is great if you’re on the move a lot or frequently away from the (home) office. What’s even better is that it has all of the functionality of the desktop version. This isn’t some stripped-down, “lite” edition that only lets you do half the things you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same connectivity, but mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #2: Set your virtual office hours with Slack notifications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both desktop and mobile apps, Slack lets you customize your notifications settings so you can be available when you want to be available and off-the-clock when you need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you really need some downtime from work, you can even turn off notifications completely. Other users will be told your notifications are off – and in an emergency, they can always force the message through so you don’t miss any of the important things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the best thing about using Slack is the ability to auto-set your working hours. So, while you can manually switch to Do-Not-Disturb if you need a few focus hours, you can also set a schedule so Slack notifications are automatically paused outside the specified times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #3: Mastering Slack channel customization &amp;amp; management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make separate channels for specialized topics, specific teams, or even one dedicated to casual chats among colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channels make sure people get the messages they need without having to sift through ones they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can manage channels in a few neat ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set custom notifications for each channel. For example, chances are if something has posted in our content creation channel, I need to see it. I don’t, however, need to read every message posted in product feedback in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star channels (and DMs) to keep track of important conversations. This moves that channel to a special section in your sidebar so it’s easier to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mute channels you don’t want updates from but don’t want to leave entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pin messages to the top of the channel. This is great for posting channel-specific guidelines, reminders for your team, or useful resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #4: Shoutout to @everyone @here! Just @ me your tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in channels, sometimes you want to loop a person into a conversation or have an announcement everyone should see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be a problem particularly for those working across time zones when not everyone is online at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@everyone and @channel will notify everyone in the channel, whether they’re online or off, while @here will alert only those in the channel currently online. To grab a specific person’s attention, just @ their username and they’ll be able to join in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #5: Ping Future You a reminder&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack lets you message yourself. Here you can easily draft messages or leave yourself notes without worrying about losing them, accidentally hitting “send” before you meant to (yep, the whole channel did just see that meme only your best work-buddy understands), or totally forget where you wrote that note you need. Don’t judge. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never been simpler to talk to Future You and let them know important details they need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #6: Don’t just react, emote!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text convos can seem a little dry and impersonal – until you add emojis. Emojis make everything fun – including business documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there’s the standard ability to add emojis to the end of a message, but Slack takes it one step further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you highlight a message, a taskbar will pop up allowing you to react to, reply to, share, or save the message. Not only does this offer you a quick, seamless way to acknowledge communication, it removes the clutter of the entire team replying with variations of “OK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #7: Manage your data like a boss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you remember that URL your colleague posted a few days ago in the team channel with all those resources on exactly the project you’re working on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you don’t because you didn’t think to bookmark it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry. Pop into message search and type your colleague’s name, when the message was sent, or any other part of the conversation you remember, and you can search through all your message history to find what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the search bar at the top of your Slack workspace and choose what you want to look for (messages, files, channels, or people) and then where or who you’re looking for, and Slack will show you every item that matches those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, there’s a specific section for threads you’re part of, so you can always scroll back through that to get that super valuable URL, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS plus – export your workspace data and download a copy of all messages, links, and files shared in your workspace’s public channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Basic Slack tip #8: Knowledge increases by sharing, not saving&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is all about sharing – and Slack lets you embrace all those community-type vibes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send files, screenshots, videos – whatever you need to share with your team is as simple as attaching it to a message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the big deal, right? Every app can do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack file sharing is a little bit different, though. Once you upload a file to a public channel, everyone in that channel can access it. They (and you) can also create external links to share with people outside the workspace when needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building a better MVP]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been researching a lot of early startups and talking to these folks, and I have noticed some patterns that I think you should avoid…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/building-a-better-MVP/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/building-a-better-MVP/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have been researching a lot of early startups and talking to these folks, and I have noticed some patterns that I think you should avoid when you are trying to build a product first company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a subject matter expert in a field, this doesn’t necessarily mean you are an expert at understanding the behaviour &amp;amp; motivation of your users, understand this before you build. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be a user of your product, but all of us have biases, so please talk to folks to whom your product could be useful , but they are tangentially different from you. When you think about users, know that research/patterns exist for a reason, don’t build something overly new - in terms of designs, flows &amp;amp; usage,remember this - one small change at a time. Don’t try to achieve a LOT in the first months of launching only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t do anything until you document
(1) Each feature
(2) The behavior of each user interaction with the feature
(3) The system response to each user interaction.
(4) What data should be collected and saved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this can be done in plain English and organized in a word document. With a table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People think about launches very differently :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build in public&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waitlist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Founder led hype&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do all or none, however product needs marketing, because even a good product needs to be FOUND. And account for it, dont dismiss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your team in place. Do not think that you will have time to fix tech debt &amp;amp; build a bad system (unless ofc you are not a tech heavy product, then ignore this) Always build efficiently even at MVP stage people expect products to work as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3 main ideas behind MVP development are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functionality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short period of time, from a minimum but sufficient functionality, a software development team makes a product to verify high-risk hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what is the minimum number of features? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it only an authorization flow and a start onboarding screen, or is it a full-fledged application with a limited amount of the most necessary features? The latter is the closest to the right answer. But how can we understand what functions are critical and what aren’t? Prioritization will help you resolve this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Define Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, you should define the product goal and the target audience, as well as to conduct competitor analysis. There are several questions that significantly simplify this task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What problem does my product solve? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who is experiencing this problem? You can’t create a product for everyone.(Stressing on this, a lot). It also makes no sense to deliver a service that nobody needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How frequent is this problem? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do people solve this problem now? Find the means that let customers cope with it. How can you facilitate this process? Is it possible to suggest a new, faster and more convenient way? How can the existing solutions be improved?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feature Priority Matrix&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agile development teams use the 2×2 prioritization approach to determine which features, fixes, and enhancements to work on next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agile product team can use this approach to identify the limited number of features needed for a minimum viable product (MVP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feature Buckets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metric movers: Features that are intended to positively affect the main KPIs. Your project success or failure will be judged by the KPIs, so this bucket is essential in terms of reaching business goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delights: Things that increase customer satisfaction, for instance, some cool animations, entertaining elements, leaderboard, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customer requests: Features that users would like to see in the app. This functionality is not required to solve the principal problem, but customers do want to have it. In a messaging application, for instance, it can be integration with Instagram, new funny sticker packs, or the ability to design emojis. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;MVP is always a guess. The faster you present it to people, the less time and resources you spend to get into the learning lifecycle. Any additional work beyond what is required to start learning is a waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to read more efficiently]]></title><description><![CDATA[ Read without the voice in your head   .

Oftentimes all of us read with a voice, either you vocalize and move their lips while reading or you subvocalize, which means you are silently talking to yourself in the head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are used to this. Turns out that you can do without it. Read visually and don’t sound them in your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re reading (say in English) you typically read from left to right, word by word. This nature comes common to us because as a child you had to understand every word and you also read slower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But try this, when you now look at a word, you can see more than one. That’s because our vision can accommodate more. Reading should be an activity which involves only the eyes and the brain. Vocalization ties reading to actual speaking, which is a comparatively slow activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know this when I grew up and considered this a sign of being weak at reading. The best way to read fast is actually &lt;strong&gt; to use your finger to follow the words &lt;/strong&gt;. When you don’t have an active object to follow, your eyes don’t move as quickly. Try both ways and see the difference for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Change your reading speed according to what you’re reading. &lt;/strong&gt; Average readers have the same reading pace for everything which can affect quality of comprehension. Poor readers habitually read and re-read the same phrase over and over again. This habit of making “regressions” doubles or triples reading time and often does not result in better comprehension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try summarizing what you know. Most people do highlights on pages, but for me I never go back to these(maybe my poor system, could improve here) but if I write my understanding of the book it helps me move on to the next and helps me retain better as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Using bigger font sizes are a game-changer. &lt;/strong&gt; Using the kindle app on a large tablet did wonders for my reading speed. Also, just an addition to it that helped me recently was immersive reading, i.e.. audible at 2.1x + reading the book together. Increasing playback speed bit by bit. Also got natural readers extension for Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there’s one reading technique that’s going to help the most, it’s improving our consistency. Consistency really is king. Just as the key to YouTube growth is posting 1-3 new videos every week, the key to reading growth is picking up our book for a small chunk of time every day. Although James Clear recommends reading 20 pages at the start of our day, I think it’s easier to set a time target of 20 minutes. And if we have an average reading speed of 250 words per minute, we’ll roughly get through a book every week by doing this. Small actions really do lead to big results &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why should you use a project tracker]]></title><description><![CDATA[Statistics show that no matter how hard you try, your project is probably going to fail.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics show that no matter how hard you try, your project is probably going to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be a little more specific, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/crowdbotics/hips-dont-lie-15-project-management-stats-you-can-t-ignore-6f655060ef30&quot;&gt;2.5% of companies&lt;/a&gt; complete their projects 100% successfully. Yet the cost of project failures is staggering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the good news is, failure, and how it affects you and your project’s overall success and profitability is controllable. If you can catch, or even predict, failures early enough, you can execute damage control measures and prevent them from completely derailing your project and its profitability. You can even use them to improve your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you catch or predict failures early?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A project tracker is a snapshot of your entire project. It gives you and the project team a clear picture of how the project is performing, where the weak spots are, and which areas need the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a list of reason for project failures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1: Lack of transparency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in the project, from the stakeholders and executives right down to the project managers and team members need to know what’s going on in the project. If people can’t see what’s going on, or aren’t kept up-to-date with progress, they lose interest, lose faith, and lose control of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2: Failure to spot warning signs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects don’t fail without warning. Missed deadlines, scope changes, lack of engagement from the team, and rising costs are common red flags that are usually raised when something’s not right. If you can’t identify these red flags, you can’t do anything about them – until it’s too late and the project has failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3: Inadequate resource allocation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improper resource allocation is the reason why 10% of projects fail. If you can’t see what your team is working on or how they’re performing against the project goals, you can’t possibly know how or where to allocate resources to ensure deadlines and expectations are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4: Lack of structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your project is like a journey. The structure of your project is therefore like a map that provides direction and keeps you on the right track. You may encounter some unforeseen stops or diversions, but a good structure will get you to your end destination. Without it, you’ll get lost in project failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A project management process like this will give you and your project a solid structure to work from. It’s your map. It will help you plan, set-up, and work through your essential project management tasks and ensure you don’t miss any vital steps during the execution of your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good project tracker gives you a top-level insight into every aspect of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides a level of transparency that allows you to analyze and measure performance, monitor time spent on tasks, spot potential problems, and track progress towards end-goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one quick glance, a project tracker will enable you to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately establish the status of the tasks within your project; what’s behind, what’s on track, and what’s teetering on the edge of failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instantly spot budding issues and fix them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effortlessly update team members and stakeholders with deadlines and goals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter whether your team is experienced or you’ve just finished onboarding them. Problems and issues have nowhere to hide with a project tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are project trackers really necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Some may ask why tracking project progress is even necessary. After all, it can seem like an administrative overhead” *&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But also completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I can’t deny that keeping track of projects can be seen as nothing more than an ‘administrative overhead’ by some, I’m a firm believer that a project tracker is an essential tool to have if you want your project to be a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at it in another way. Check out the below, eyewatering, statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectmanagementworks.co.uk/project-failure-statistics/&quot;&gt;30% of projects&lt;/a&gt; fail due to poor communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proprofs.com/c/project/project-management-statistics-facts-trends/&quot;&gt;One-third of projects&lt;/a&gt; fail due to lack of senior management involvement in crucial project decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.capterra.com/10-need-to-know-project-management-statistics-for-2018/&quot;&gt;59% of U.S. workers&lt;/a&gt; say communication is their project team’s biggest obstacle to success&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.capterra.com/10-need-to-know-project-management-statistics-for-2018/&quot;&gt;29% of companies&lt;/a&gt; say that accountability is the biggest contributor to failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workamajig.com/blog/project-management-statistics&quot;&gt;33% of projects&lt;/a&gt; fail because of a lack of involvement from senior management or stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you think organizations could improve each one of these statistics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guessed it – by using a project tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience with these trackers were mostly good, but also tedious. I’d manually fill out each project tracker and run-through it with the project team and stakeholders on a weekly basis (or whatver’s necessary)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knew where the project was at. We could all see the status of each task. We were able to spot the issues before they became issues, and we knew which areas of the project were over-stretched and needed extra help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were a great way to keep track of where the projects were in terms of goals and budget, and also to make sure everyone was clear on progress and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my God, they were painfully long and laborious documents to fill out each week!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s nothing wrong with creating a Word or Google Doc and manually updating it to track the progress of your projects, it can be an inefficient use of time and it can lead to inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, there are so many intuitive pieces of software, platforms, and tools that you can use to easily and accurately track the progress of your projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choose tools that integrate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrations are connections between tools that automate the transfer of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you might want to integrate your emails with Trello so you can automatically create Trello cards (tasks) out of emails and cut down on copy/pasting. Another example could be automatically uploading certain Dropbox files to Asana, saving you time moving files around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself doing a lot of data entry, or updating multiple apps with the same information, integrations are sure to solve that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basecamp, ClickUp, Asana and Teamwork have a similar wide library of integrations, plus Zapier functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a big list of PM tools that integrate, check Zapier’s guide out &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/learn/project-management/best-project-management-software&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beginner's guide to digital marketing]]></title><description><![CDATA[Digital Marketing general information When you get down to it,  digital marketing  is simply marketing.

But they all work together to create a foundation for your business: attracting prospects, nurturing relationships, and making offers your audience will appreciate and respond to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at how that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital marketing consists of these major skills :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge to use Google Ads (Google’s advertising platform)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Things like interface, technicalities, PPC and how to launch campaigns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run your first campaigns for yourself to get some experience and don’t worry if it fails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The secret is to spend less while making more money&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to learn : Google themselves provide free tutorials + there are some tutorials on the web&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SEO (Search Engine Optimization)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice of using organic strategies to rank higher on search engines, mostly google
Three elements to SEO -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On page SEO&lt;/strong&gt; : Optimizes each individual page of a website to target a specific keyword and appeal to search engines. These strategies include : keyword research, content creation and keyword optimization. Helps search engines understand a page of content and therefore it gives higher ranks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical SEO&lt;/strong&gt; : Optimizes the non-content elements of a website and the website as a whole to improve its backend structure and foundation.These strategies relate to : site speed, mobile friendliness, indexing, crawlability, site architecture, structured data, and security. Improves both user and search crawler experience, which leads to higher search rankings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off-page SEO&lt;/strong&gt; : Builds a website’s reputation and authority by connecting it to other high-quality websites. Off page SEO techniques include : link building from other websites and manage local listings and directory profiles. When many websites link to a brand’s website, it shows search engines that the brand’s website is trustworthy, reliable and reputable, which increases its search rankings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SEM (Search engine marketing)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinda like SEO, but unlike SEO (which uses only organic non-paid strategies) and SEM used paid strategies to appear in search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SMM (Social Media Marketing)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both organic (free) and paid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Email Marketing/Email list building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see the highest ROI when you build and maintain an engaged subscriber list, made up of people who want to receive your messages (and who opted in on purpose).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/5mzoii/60_email_marketing_strategies_ideas_and_examples/&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge to startup, read and understand analytics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing analytics is used to determine the level of success of various marketing efforts for the overall campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conversion Optimization : How to optimize anything (website, content, video etc.) to get more paid leads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CRO process involves understanding how users move through your site, what actions they take, and what’s stopping them from completing your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ways to gain experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consume as much digital marketing related knowledge and information as you possibly can (courses, books, videos, articles, blogs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow as many digital marketing related sources (websites, blogs, youtube accounts) to stay updated and relevant to trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a website for what you want, create content on it and do the seo and marketing for it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a local SEO digital marketing company and ask for work experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for entry level openings at startups/digital marketing agencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to start&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get yourself Google Tag Manager (tagmanager.google.com) and install that pixel on the page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get all your tracking pixels in the tag container - so your Facebook Tracking Pixel, then Twitter, Quora, Adwords, LinkedIn, Reddit - they all have tracking pixels mate. Get all of them! Also get hotjar.com, so you have some actual visibility on your site as to what people are actually doing - every swipe, tap, mouse movement and click - all recorded for you to see what people are ACTUALLY doing on your site versus what you THINK they’re doing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your Google Search Console hooked up with your Google Analytics hooked up with your Adwords - there’s heaps to this, and it’s a pain in the arse, won’t lie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup your conversion pixel events in all the ones i mentioned in (2) - these are different to the standard page tracking pixels, as they track who comes to which of your pages: What a CONVERSION pixel does though, is to track when someone purchases, or where they sign up to your newsletter or call you etc - actual things that make you money there and then, as opposed to just tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create custom audiences in Facebook, Twitter, Adwords and all the ones in (2). A custom audience is where you take your existing emails and upload them into each platform, where the platform then matches the emails to accounts on that platform. Now  you may only have 100-200 emails for example, and these WON’T be enough to then run an advert to, BUTTTTT you can then create “lookalike audiences” in the platforms where each platform goes off and finds people that very closely match the qualities, aspirations, hopes, dreams, desires and marketing demographics of the millions of available people it has data on (see why Facebook is under massive PR scrutiny now?) and then gives you that audience to market to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a newsletter opt-in that pops up on the site after a set scroll period and/or time on site. Also set the popup to appear when someone is exiting the site - this is literally called an “exit intent” popup. They were going to leave anyway, so might as well try and get their details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create further custom audiences of people that visit specific pages or click specific buttons or who add to shopping cart but then don’t purchase - as well as one for purchasers too! These custom audiences will be great for what we call “retargeting” or “remarketing” - they’re where people come to your site, and do some shit but don’t buy anything for example, but the tracking pixels “fire” and when they go back into their social media platform of choice - well, there is the retargeting advert for the product they were looking at or the category they were choosing from. You will have seen this yourself when looking at a piece of clothing or wallet or whatever - when you don’t buy it, the product then seems to follow you around the internet no matter where you go (if the marketer is skilled enough!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKE SURE you have your Google Analytics setup with your ecommerce package too - so when people start to buy, you know where they are, what device, what time best converts, how many times they came back to the site before purchasing - and then be able to break down which product(s) are selling best based on actual data rather than gut feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have your Instagram account setup for business use, and make sure you apply for shopping tags usage - these will be invaluable for you to have people tap on your item picture in your feed WITHOUT ads (sometimes!) for people to then tap and buy there. Powerful stuff but you have to get your instagram account verified as a business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of business verification - get your Google My Business all setup too. We’ve talked about Analytics + Search Console etc here already, but when you get your Google My Business all setup with address on the map that gets verified, phone number, web address and open hours etc - that then leads to great things: Review extensions, location extensions and call extensions and basically ALL the Adwords Ad Extensions can then be used to trounce your competitors. All can be setup free, apart from the PPC obviously!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get cracking with video content! Show some products being made, show them in use from customers who tell how happy they are, show kids with your patches - really pull at heart strings and invest someone’s emotion watching the videos. Yes, even for patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup your YouTube channel also - get those videos up there on YouTube and Facebook on your business page AND ON YOUR PERSONAL FB Profile too! Do business from your personal profiles and treat all the social networks as business avenues now, rather than post family and friends shit - still DO that, but keep it to a minimum so you can show people some transparency on the person BEHIND the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re hooked up in your Google Search Console, feel free to then activate your YouTube cards with the link back to your site that can be sprung at any time during the video. Here’s the kicker though - YT recently fucked everyone in small business just starting out, by saying you can’t have that feature unless you have a load of subscribers and watch time. Buy them. Don’t worry about it - you’re not giving a flying fuck about these fake subscribers as you’re ONLY doing this to get the YT Cards with Link feature unlocked. Don’t feel bad or fake - YT brought this on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live stream your heart out. Live stream the devices being made and again, show viewers some genuine heartstring tugging stories. That shit gets shared. A LOT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram influencer marketing is good when it works - but check their account for number of fake followers Vs genuine followers. There’s heaps of free tools around, but at time of writing Facebook (who own instagram) are cracking down on their API so a lot of the tools will stop working soon. Find one. Rape it for info as much as you can for as long as you can, and then DM these account holders offering them a referral fee - you’ll need a UTM tracking URL for that Influencer to give out so you can track any sales back to them. OR you can agree to a set fee - say 4c per genuine follower for a shout. Results will vary, but at least you know you got tools to analyse an Insta account now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think that Facebook, Instagram and Youtube Ads for visibility and traffic, with MAYBE Adwords for retargeting (retargeting traffic is way cheaper than “cold” traffic, by the way) would be the way to go for this. Just a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See if you can get some PR by using SourceBottle or HelpAReporter and being featured in blogs, magazines, TV etc as a “feel good” story. Free to do, just your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run a search on your competitors sites using WhatRunsWhere and see what keywords they’re using on their site - you then use that info to write blogs around those keywords and also to run better ads than them on Adwords!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKE SURE you have your telephone number on the site too - a lot of times people just want to talk to someone. At the top of your page, put the number and the “Message Us” too - this could be a Facebook Messenger widget button that will then message your page, or if could be using something like the billions of website instant messaging SaaS out there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to have the traditional “Get Newsletter” snoozefest, then make sure you have a great CRM that you’re going to USE to send those cool as fuck and interesting newsletters - start with MailChimp or Active Campaign. These tags allow you to automate sending based on those tags existing or not - another conversation about all this as it’s more complex than to write here, about audience segmentation and marketing automation etc). There’s a cool Wordpress plugin to use called - wowq.io - this can ask them all questions on a popup quiz or questionnaire and then tag each answer they give, which then “talks” to your CRM and then auto sends out your email content based on their answer(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The ultimate guide to job hunting [Part 2]]]></title><description><![CDATA[So let’s head into the other milestones one will encounter while looking for jobs, while I want to stress again on how mentally daunting it…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/Step-by-Step-guide-to-job-hunting-part-two/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/Step-by-Step-guide-to-job-hunting-part-two/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So let’s head into the other milestones one will encounter while looking for jobs, while I want to stress again on how mentally daunting it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you came to this page directly, you may want to refer to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://catwomaniya.io/Step-by-Step-guide-to-job-hunting-part-one/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; for more resources and insights in the job hunting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into the next step - the &lt;strong&gt;DREADED&lt;/strong&gt; interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/162eb909006b90ddb4bce075cc902182/s77.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Stressful interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prepare for an interview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Before the interview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Keep applying&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So just because, you are having hearing back from companies to schedule interviews, doesn’t mean you should stop applying to other companies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Practice with a lot of mock interviews&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write down answers to common questions and practice them , up to a point it doesn’t sound rehearsed and comes naturally to you. Cannot stress this enough.
Personally, I see around 40-50 generic questions that anyone can prepare for. For example - &lt;a href=&quot;https://novoresume.com/career-blog/interview-questions-and-best-answers-guide&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Research the company.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go through their website, social media handles, news, etc. Also, check with your network for someone who knows about the company or is an employee there, to understand their business well. Also, think of areas that you could suggest for improvement and brainstorm solutions around it, to articulate your understanding of what the company’s offerings are. Also, write all of these down somewhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Setup the interview time&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can, try to get your interview to happen in the middle of the week and earlier in the day. Mondays are notoriously busy with catching up after the weekends, while Fridays have the negative aspect of a possible loss of interest in you over the weekend. Aim for earlier interviews, like an hour before lunch, at least, but not as soon as the office hours begin; both you and your interviewer will be less likely to feel hungry, grouchy, and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What to bring&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming, interviews are still mostly being conducted virtually now, the bottom line is that not to carry anything extra to the interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your notes from researching the company handy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, keep copies of whatever application you sent to the company with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, have a glass of water near you, in case you are stuck on a question in the middle of the interview, and you want to naturally take a break, to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a backup plan, in case your Wi-Fi is spotty, and you need to switch to another network immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;30 minutes before the interview&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join the link (or arrive at the location) 5-10 minutes before the meeting starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch off your phone (or put it on silent)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay calm and take deep breaths. At the end of the day, it’s just a friendly conversation, where both parties want to see if they are a good fit for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. During the interview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviewing virtually has its benefits (wearing pyjamas to interviews) but it also has its flaws - less room to communicate with another person, as other communication traits like body language and gestures aren’t comprehensible. So it’s essential to get the basics right, like speaking coherently and maintaining eye contact every now and then with a mild smile is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a good practice to not interrupt the interviewer, and to take a few seconds to answer when a question has been asked, to show that you have thought through the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also very important to ask questions because at the end of every interview, good or bad, it’s a standard practice when recruiters ask candidates if they have any questions. Prepare for at least 3 of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries&quot;&gt;Good site for finding relevant questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.in/careers/news/34-brilliant-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-every-job-interview/slidelist/77662033.cms#slideid=77662351&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/95s26w/what_are_great_questions_to_ask_your_interviewer/&quot;&gt;Another guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank the interviewer for his/her time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. After the interview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Thank you note&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately send a thank you email to the person who interviewed you (probably sooner and definitely by the end of the day) . It’s not that this will save you from a bad interview, but it’s a good practice, in general. And even if it was a legitimate bad interview, this note can help explain in very minimal words, for your abysmal performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-an-interview-thankyou-note-an-email-template&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analyse your performance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log the interview details in your job hunting tracker (maybe on the spreadsheet)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, take some time to analyse how you performed in the interview, and if there was something you could have done better (details, questions you couldn’t answer etc.). Do note down the mistakes that you made, why they happened and how to avoid them in the next interview, you could even ask the interviewer for feedback if they say you failed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Follow up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t hear from them by the deadline (the date they will reply back) then follow up after a week (even earlier if you know that they were looking for an immediate hire)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, keep sending applications and still do job hunting, just because you aced the interview does not mean you got the job, and besides two job offers are better than one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional links :&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brandyourself.com/blog/career/interview-questions/43-tips-for-job-interview-before-during-and-after/&quot;&gt;https://brandyourself.com/blog/career/interview-questions/43-tips-for-job-interview-before-during-and-after/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.experisjobs.us/exp_us/en/career-advice/20-tips-job-interviews.htm&quot;&gt;https://www.experisjobs.us/exp_us/en/career-advice/20-tips-job-interviews.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zety.com/blog/job-interview-questions-and-answers&quot;&gt;https://zety.com/blog/job-interview-questions-and-answers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When you actually get an offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, amazing! Now, the negotiation dance begins. Also, this specifically means when you have an official document for a job offer and not something that was verbally mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to negotiate your salary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/788b1c6849743780aaf3393e189c9276/s78.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Negotiate salary meme&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you should never give a number when they ask you for it. If it’s an online form just fill in NA or the lowest possible value. If they ask what you have in mind in terms of salary, say: “well, I was curious what your budget is for this role as I’m wondering if we are on the same page when it comes to compensation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they refuse to give you any numbers or give a vague answer then -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try saying: “Well, I’m not really sure, it depends on a lot of factors like my responsibilities, and who I will be working with that will be needed to give an appropriate answer to this question… what do you think?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes recruits directly reject candidates based on their very high salary demand so it’s better to not give a number, at least, not in the first meeting directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, giving a salary range is not useful. For example, if you say your salary requirement is in the range of INR 20-24 LPA, then you would be thinking your earning potential here is INR 24 LPA but the recruiter thinks that he can hire you for INR 20 LPA. If you are probed for a salary range, quote a wide range like INR 15-30 LPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could bluff and give a high number, at least 15-25% more than you earn at your current/last job, since they will undercut you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if they say: “oh but your last employer said that you were paid $$$ at your last job, so why should we pay more?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, you could then say: “well just because they valued me at that number, does not mean that’s what I’m worth right now, and there were multiple factors at play such as them not having enough budget, so now are you willing to meet me at this salary?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to manage multiple job offers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s not easy. But you can ask companies to take maximum 2-3 days to think about an offer, before confirming it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use this offer letter to fast track any current interview process. It’s not a fool-proof method, but if a company thinks you’re resourceful and hireable, and will be suddenly going out of the market, then they may try to finish off their process sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;strong&gt;two offers are always better than one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did a lot of research and made sure that everything is correct and accurate. But mistakes do happen. so if you feel that there is something wrong or you want to give feedback, feel free to contact me through my Twitter handle or directly email me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The ultimate guide to job hunting [Part 1]]]></title><description><![CDATA[Job hunting is really tough and there’s not exactly a best practices guide lying around to help people, especially newbies who are new to…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/Step-by-Step-guide-to-job-hunting-part-one/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/Step-by-Step-guide-to-job-hunting-part-one/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Job hunting is really tough and there’s not exactly a best practices guide lying around to help people, especially newbies who are new to the workforce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the job market, I decided to take notes and experiment to find what the best methods are to land a job, personally because I was fresh out of college and struggling, but also, I knew right then that this information I am accumulating may come in handy to someone else later on. As jobs become scarcer, and applicants more competitive, one needs to get creative and improve the process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a long post which took me two weeks to compile. The guide has 100+ useful links and resources about job hunting – is well structured – is filled with jokes and memes (because I can’t help myself)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Job Hunting Process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application -&amp;gt; Interview(s) -&amp;gt; Offer -&amp;gt; Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most hardest part here is getting an interview, because not every resume gets noticed unless it’s really outstanding or if it applied via a contact in the company. This process becomes ten folds difficult if you’re a fresher with zero experience, because you will have to play the game of numbers, network with college alums/ask for referrals, do internships (pray that internship turns into a job offer), and countless other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating your job application&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go start looking for companies, you need to have your application in order. This whole subject can turn into another whole article but I will be concise here. Firstly, depending on what country you belong to (or basically what job market you are part of), a job application can mean different things: Resume, CV, Cover letter, Portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CV (Curriculum Vitae)&lt;/strong&gt; is a very in-depth document that describes your career journey in a step-by-step manner. You can think of a CV as a very comprehensive document of everything you have ever done, so it can easily go beyond 2,3 pages. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resume&lt;/strong&gt; is a one-pager document that is short and straight to the point, where you only mention things that’s directly relevant to the job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cover letter&lt;/strong&gt; is a one pager document that is normally sent along with a CV or resume while applying. It’s goal is to introduce you and briefly summarize your professional experience in 250-400 words (ideally)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio&lt;/strong&gt; is a showcase of your talents in the form of projects or achievements. Ex – If you’re a web developer, you could probably show a beautiful responsive website that you built.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What to list in your job application&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When listing an experience, try to list out in a way that tells the reader how you achieved X by doing Y, and use numbers. For example – &lt;em&gt;“Redefined 15 internal processes across functions that improved employee productivity by 46%”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;List knowledge/experience that’s relevant to the job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;List your education briefly and only list down important details as most employers don’t care much about your education, they only care about your experience and whether you are a good fit for the job. If you’re a fresher however, do prioritize this section and mention your GPA as it matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always list your last job, as current, and list it down in a chronological manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do list your personal information (name, phone number, email ID, website etc.) and ensure it’s up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Should you have a website&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Having a website makes you seem more professional and committed and that you can learn and create something. In this day and age, it’s fairly easy to have one also using tools like Wordpress, Wix etc. But the thing is you need a domain and a hosting plan to have a website and that costs money, as little as INR 200 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use a solution which is free but it may not give you an option to choose the domain or may have limits based on the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/&quot;&gt;About.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://carrd.co/&quot;&gt;Caard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; (Mostly for devlopers and tech people)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other sites based on your specific work also exist. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/&quot;&gt;Dribble&lt;/a&gt; for designers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get an interview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that you have a fair idea of what kind of work and what kind of role you will be applying for, you can proceed with applying to job listings that is suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Send applications&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think, the first thing you should do before delving into job portals and applying to any relevant job is create a tracker for job hunting. You can use the below spreadsheet and copy it for your own use –&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_k0-1WvIEh65tNyDAoOjkVV_Fr-nmGbwktuuWgBKgO0/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Job_Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Send out applications every day&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One should at least be sending out 5 applications every day, even though it seems a little bit exaggerated, but this should be your daily goal. Given the bandwidth I had, I could only send 1-2 applications every day, and that’s okay even if you can’t reach the goal because in the end it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Set up job alerts for specific roles/companies&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which ever job portal you go to do set up job alerts for roles you are looking for, so that once you get the alert you can immediately go and apply on the portal. Time is of essence, and even in a day’s time a job posting can get hundreds of applications, so the sooner you apply, the greater is the chance for the hiring folks to check out your profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Make your resume ATS-proof&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most applications get filtered via Applicant Tracking System (ATS) before they get in front of a real human (aka Human Resources), so it’s important to follow certain rules like following correct structure, using right keywords etc. otherwise the system would directly disqualify you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip : Here is one way to tell if your resume is going through an ATS and if so, which one. While on the careers page of a company’s website watch the URL in the address bar of your browser to see if it changes after you click the “apply now” button. After you click “apply now” look for names in the URL like “workday”, “applicanttracking”, “paycom”, “brassring”, and “lever”. These are the names of popular applicant tracking systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-an-applicant-tracking-systems-ats-2061926&quot;&gt;How ATS works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8ml5s8/i_made_a_guide_on_how_you_can_overcome_some/&quot;&gt;ATS guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobscan.co/&quot;&gt;Jobscan&lt;/a&gt; - A free tool to scan your resume and its compatibility with a given job role&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Don’t forget to apply on company’s website&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like the courting ritual, if I can call it that. They like to see that the candidate has put in the effort to go to their website and apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid the entire process altogether, there are methods like directly emailing to the concerned hiring manager or HR. More often than not, when you’re applying for jobs via LinkedIn, you can also see the name of the person who posted that job. And when you have their name, the next step is to guess the person’s email ID, and since the majority of them are like, it gets a little easy –&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Firstname”.”lastname”@”companydomain”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“firstletteroffirstname””lastname”@“companydomain”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a link to a tool to find emails – &lt;a href=&quot;https://hunter.io/&quot;&gt;hunter.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, when you’re sending these emails, a better idea is also to give a brief description about yourself, your past experiences and how you can add value to the company, in the email body itself. You can also directly copy your cover letter (if you already have one) and make some modifications to keep it small and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, just sending emails isn’t the final step, you also need to follow up in a few days, because it’s possible that the person actually missed out on your email ID. A basic rule, is that you should be following up at least twice before that contact becomes cold. This is also why you should have a tracker, because it gets messy following this mechanism and checking up with people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email template for job applications –&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An efficient way to email employers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this may come off as a hack, based on how you see it, but a little automation can become really useful and save your time while sending emails to companies. Just do what sales personnel do – &lt;strong&gt;Create an email campaign&lt;/strong&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a list of companies you’re interested in or start shortlisting job listings you want to apply for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for people relevant to the role you’re applying for and start guessing their email addresses and jotting it down on an excel spreadsheet. Then put it into the Hunter.io’s bulk verification tool to validate all emails are legitimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it isn’t you can try other combinations of the emails or simply send it to “ta@companydomain” OR “hr@companydomain” OR “careers@companydomain” as a next option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Import the list of email ids into Hunter.io’s email campaign sender tool. This is a pretty awesome tool that allows you to send semi-personalized emails to many people at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a cold email explaining who you are, your past experiences and how you can add value to the company, in the email body itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send out a test email, just to see how it looks like and to check for errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run the email campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success rate is considerably higher and the effort spent is well, less (around 1-2 hours). I did try this once and send it to 30 companies, from which it led to ~4 interviews (response rate of 13%), which is pretty good given that most companies do not bother sending out any email if you go via the traditional route of applying via job portals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/596042520ec09028e36cb1ac54964754/js3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Applying for job thug life meme&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, send as much applications as much as you can, even if the companies don’t have a job listing.  You can still send a letter of interest, a letter that expresses your interest in learning more about a particular organization’s opportunities and/or working for that organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t necessarily get disappointed if you don’t match the job requirements, they are mostly a wish list and very annoyingly even entry level jobs ask for experience in certain areas, which doesn’t make sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, do not stop applying for jobs even after an interview or an offer, it’s always better for you to have two options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can take even 500+ applications to land a job, do not give up, you just need one that will make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should normally follow up a week after sending an application. (Unless explicitly stated to not reach out to the employers regarding the application status OR if an exact response date is mentioned in the job ad or in the response email which they send after applying)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to follow up?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In either case, whether you’re applying via job portal or emailing your application directly, the hiring manager email id will come in handy. (Go to LinkedIn and then use Hunter) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send an email to the Hiring manager telling him/her that you have applied and why you love the company and why you should be given an interview. Don’t stop with the hiring manager, also try to find the highest person you can reach out to you and speak about how you admire their work and how you can contribute in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow up until you get a response (no matter how uncomfortable you feel). It isn’t that annoying, as much as you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a company said no, do follow up after a couple of months, Surprisingly, I had a company follow me up for another role many months later when they had an opening, that they thought I was a suitable candidate for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Templates for a follow up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/follow-up-email-after-interview&quot;&gt;Template 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalancecareers.com/follow-up-letter-sample-2062545&quot;&gt;Template 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/follow-up-template/&quot;&gt;Template 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to stand out&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do extensive research about the organization, their values, their products and services, their customers. Go through their website and definitely check if they were on the news recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, try to bring together your experience with the needs of the role. Make sure your pitch is clean and straightforward, on why you are a good fit for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Good platforms for job hunting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; (Most popular one, but also sees the most applications)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://in.indeed.com/&quot;&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; (Has many job listings, LinkedIn seems limited in comparison)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.co.in/&quot;&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; (You can also find reviews about the company, which is a plus) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startup.jobs/&quot;&gt;Startup.jobs&lt;/a&gt; (Contains openings for tech start-ups)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://angel.co/&quot;&gt;Angel.co&lt;/a&gt; (Contains openings for all start-ups. Pretty useful if you are interested in working for a start-up.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will continue this in Part 2 of the guide where I will specifically talk about Interview Prep and share more resources, or else this will become exceedingly long&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best SEO link building practices to follow]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am also new to the world of link building and based on my research I have found some of the tried and tested stratgeies to improve a…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/SEO-link-building/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/SEO-link-building/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I am also new to the world of link building and based on my research I have found some of the tried and tested stratgeies to improve a website’s ranking using site building, as mentioned below -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1.	Co-authoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requesting to co-author content with other websites is a great way to increase backlinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great win-win situation, where you’re building the links you need to increase your SEO and the admin of the site you’re writing for will have a well-written piece of content for their readers, with very little being exchanged to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, not only will you have the benefit of increased links to boost your SEO with other search engines, but it also helps in extending your reach to other audiences by putting your content and links in front of more eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.	Checking competitor’s backlinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking a competitor’s backlinks can turn out to be fruitful as you’ll find at least a few links that you aren’t targeting. If they were able to acquire these backlinks, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to compete with them for keyword dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For doing this analysis, there are tools that are specifically made, where you can create a report to discover common backlinks, as well as learn more about the sources and techniques being used by your competitors to get those links. For ex – Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Help a reporter out (HARO)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something that I read about in another article. The HARO platform gives journalists a powerful database of sources to draw from. There are opportunities daily for sources to contribute and obtain media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the platform, you can work as a source to pitch story ideas to journalists and, in turn, get backlinks. The backlinks obtained through HARO are generally authoritative leaders in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just requires to register yourself on the website to being receiving source requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Start a blog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogging is a great technique to use in your link building. If you don’t already have a blog included on your website, get started right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you write about relevant information, you can be rewarded with backlinks for providing authoritative content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also choose to write blogs about the latest trending topics in your field. If these are new topics, there won’t be much information available, so you can take advantage of the fact that you’ll be one of the few resources providing this information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Treat your testimonials like backlinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re able to work in conjunction with others, you can create a win-win situation, where both of you contribute to your mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re able to provide feedback and testimonials for other businesses, you’ll be able to create a backlink and possible traffic through that testimonial, as well as foster a sense of trust with your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backlinks through testimonials generally have a better response and approval rate than other types of links, because they’re coming from an honest review of a product or service that someone is interested in hearing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Choosing all time popular keywords and topics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to decide on which topics you’re going to write about, it’s a good idea to not just write about trending hot topics, but also include a good amount of evergreen topics and keywords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the topics that will always generate interest and that people are always searching for information about, regardless of what the latest trends are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generating consistent traffic over a long period of time is one of the best ways to get ranked higher in Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When trying to create content from your evergreen topic, remember that it’s got to be both valuable to the reader and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Master the skyscraper technique&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./s74.png&quot; alt=&quot;Skyscraper technique&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/blog/skyscraper-technique/&quot;&gt;Brian Dean of Backlinko&lt;/a&gt;, this technique involves creating unbelievable content centering around one specific issue that people are facing in your field, then presenting viable solutions to that problem through the content you offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you offer solutions that work and that people can actually accomplish, helping them solve the problem they’re facing, you can create a great deal of authority in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can become the go-to source for this solution, generating a lot of backlinks based on the authoritative dominance you’ve demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus tip: Check Wikipedia’s dead links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is viewed as a highly trusted site by Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, using them as a source for link building is a great idea, and can be highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you take a closer look, you may find that there are a number of dead or broken links within the pages of Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A free tool, such as Wikigrabber, will crawl through the pages you identify, helping to pick out the dead links so you can fix them. You can also use tools like this to search for keywords and add a citation on Wikipedia for the relevant pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(P.S.  I am still working on experimenting and finding what methods work best. Will update with the results in a few weeks.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 takeaways from solo travel to improve work performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Solo traveling taught me a lot about business leadership.

It still is one of the best decisions, I made in my life and I loved every minute of it. Throughout my life, I have tried to adapt and reflect my learnings from different experiences into any new activity or project I take on, through a process of learning, unlearning, relearning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a short list of skills I picked up while traveling abroad –&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like conducting business, travel involves many last-minute changes in plan, situations in which you will have to adapt to new environments, and countless ways of something that could go south instantly. For instance, the flight gets canceled and you end up staying in a cheap and dingy hostel, or a city shuts down due to protests leaving you handicapped with no public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resilience built during my trips abroad have helped me tough it out and get out of tough work situations, like losing a job, losing a client, missed deadlines etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Planning ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will end up improving your time management skills and personal finance, if nothing else, after you travel abroad for a couple of weeks. You will need to start planning in advance, if you want to book the cheapest flights/trains, affordable accommodation, transportation options, lowest currency exchange rates and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: I made a spreadsheet of my travel activities, for planning and budgeting, doing a cost-benefit analysis, and it came in very handy. God bless, Excel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also have to stay organized and live minimally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an Indian, I struggled with this. We like to hoard stuff and carry everything with us while traveling. Once you drop the “Maybe” tag from things, it’s easier to categorize things into two clear buckets – Needed and Not needed, that’s it, otherwise 80% of things end up in the “Maybe” pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in travel you will need contingency plans and extra funds for unforeseen challenges in business too. It won’t be common, but you face giant blockades, especially if you’re working in a start-up, like lack of funds, lack of human capital, and you can predict those with a 100% guarantee, but if you plan ahead, you will find it will take less time in working on a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim for the moon, and you will at least reach the stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Manage your time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I have always prided myself for having great time management skills, I struggled in Europe. Because a deadline of 8:00am doesn’t mean 8:00 am, it means 7:59 am, and it’s always better to arrive 10 minutes early for anything, be it a business meeting or a cruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have made all the mistakes when it comes to time management during my travels, from dashing from one place to another to see all the sites to being lazy and missing out on some pleasant experiences. As a fellow business school graduate, I take pride in working insanely and exhausting myself (which is really stupid), it’s not worth it. You cannot squeeze everything you want to do and live normally, no matter what kind of super-human you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:584px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
//&lt;em&gt;I had to put this here. Sorry, not sorry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep realistic deadlines while setting business goals and develop a better sense of time management in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.	Keep an open mind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my AirBnb hosts, a 62 year old man from Eastern France taught me more during my stay with him than any business school ever did. Experiences like these, helped me open myself up to strangers, and I wanted to learn more about everything. I have always hated small talk, so these conversations were a treasure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, networking with people could turn out to be hugely rewarding. During my stay in Denmark, I met a young Turkish woman who landed a dream job in Copenhagen because of the connections she made during a summer trip, a couple years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Think outside the box&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When traveling, you will have to deal with scarce resources, unforeseen situations, and nasty conditions. I had to learn how to optimize resources efficiently, and to always look for new opportunities to fit my budget, like staying the night at the airport instead of a backpacker’s hostel or a AirBnb, walking instead of taking the bus etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 4 months, I had learnt a decent bit of French, which turned out pretty useful when my train got cancelled midway, and I had zero knowledge why or how I was supposed to get home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these obstacles, forced me to think outside the box to get things done, come what may. I truly believe, one can get out of sticky situations, if you can see things from a different perspective, because there is always a solution out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.	Being culturally “woke”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you end up starting a global business or expand your business internationally, you will have to be aware of local preferences and cultural norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before taking on any project globally, learn about local business etiquette first. For instance, to finish a report in the school I studied in France, I had to talk to plenty of people and I went ahead and scheduled meetings with them during lunch time which was a hug NO-NO, which I learnt later. A kind French lady told me, why I was being shrugged off during these meetings, as French people believe there’s more to life than working nonstop. There’s plenty of time for that when not in a table filled with good food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.	Get out of your comfort zone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;comfort zone&quot; title=&quot;comfort zone&quot; src=&quot;/static/30436ccff196b320ffb05499b03f8bc0/1c72d/s30.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;/static/30436ccff196b320ffb05499b03f8bc0/a80bd/s30.jpg 148w,/static/30436ccff196b320ffb05499b03f8bc0/1c91a/s30.jpg 295w,/static/30436ccff196b320ffb05499b03f8bc0/1c72d/s30.jpg 590w,/static/30436ccff196b320ffb05499b03f8bc0/a8a14/s30.jpg 885w,/static/30436ccff196b320ffb05499b03f8bc0/a2510/s30.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, small talks aren’t my thing, partially because they seem like a waste of time but also because I am hesitant to walk towards someone and talk to them. Well, guess what? When you are all by yourself, it gets lonely sometimes, and you are forced to interact with strange people (something which I dreaded before). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a good thing for me, my anxiety reduced considerably, and I moved out of my comfort zone, a little bit. Not exactly a work improvement thing, but rather personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to organize your digital files better]]></title><description><![CDATA[It’s all too common to find oneself wading through the organization’s shared folders in search of the file you’ve been asked to review…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-to-organize-your-digital-files-better/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-to-organize-your-digital-files-better/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s all too common to find oneself wading through the organization’s shared folders in search of the file you’ve been asked to review:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROJECT-PROPOSAL-NEW-v5.doc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project_proposal_2020(old version).doc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen?

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Establish your information architecture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Information architecture” - Fancy term right there, but quite useful. It means the way you organize your internal information, in terms of how you &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; the system that allows you to access and manage that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Websites are a great, pragmatic example of informational architecture – they’re quite literally formal systems of information organized into an interface, that’s navigable and interactive-friendly.. Hyperlinks and site maps, all represent the architecture (the links between different pieces of information) of the websites you’re viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key point to consider here is who will need to access this information. Will there be multiple iterations of similar files, many files across different areas of the organization, multiple departments accessing the same area? And that will help you improve the efficiency of the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency can be understood as the shortest time possible taken to access any given file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How many clicks is also a relevant metric. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the folder structure unnecessarily complex, taking 10 clicks through empty category folders before reaching the destination file? Consider if more horizontal organization is a better option, with a couple of clicks to relevant files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness can be understood as whether or not the file naming conventions help or hinder the completion of daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many different files do you have to open before you find what you’re looking for? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the file naming convention intuitive, or do you need to spend extra time learning how to make sense of &lt;strong&gt;210221_SA_P-01_Project_1_Draft.doc&lt;/strong&gt;, when &lt;strong&gt;Sales_Project_Deck_June_v1.doc&lt;/strong&gt; would do just fine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Readability: Humans vs Robots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important questions you can ask is: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are you organizing your files for? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be that you’re organizing internal media files in a remote organization, or for a local intranet – in that case, you probably want the files to be human-readable. In that case, something like this might make sense:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, perhaps you’re tasked with managing large batch files for automatic processing or robotic search, in which case, human readability might not be your primary concern (though it’s probably still useful, in the least for debugging and error-chasing purposes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also browse Wikipedia using other categorization systems like Dewey Decimal, or by simply searching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is demonstrating that it’s more effective to utilize a range of different categorization and search methods, and that search is perhaps one of the most user-friendly solutions for navigating huge, complex databases of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dewey Decimal file naming convention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dewey Decimal” refers to a file naming convention. Originally, it was a method of organizing information (books) based on 10 main classes that attempted to cover… well, pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should remember that the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) was first and foremost a system designed to be used in libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;XKCD comic&quot; title=&quot;XKCD comic&quot; src=&quot;/static/3bc0af180c2efb0f4d18bb95d91dd6bb/1c72d/s73.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;/static/3bc0af180c2efb0f4d18bb95d91dd6bb/a80bd/s73.jpg 148w,/static/3bc0af180c2efb0f4d18bb95d91dd6bb/1c91a/s73.jpg 295w,/static/3bc0af180c2efb0f4d18bb95d91dd6bb/1c72d/s73.jpg 590w,/static/3bc0af180c2efb0f4d18bb95d91dd6bb/96177/s73.jpg 723w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, using numbers to divide main categories into smaller, more specific divisions and sections That’s the Dewey Decimal system in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a SMB, you don’t have so many internal processes, so it’s easier to manage them all and get to the point where you have everything under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you run a small business, you don’t need five different documented processes for storing documents or dealing with different projects and clients. Even if you manage two or three similar establishments like this, it’s easy to be sure that all of these use the same methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge you face will come when you reach the point of having 1,000 different establishments in different countries, that need to follow different laws and regulations, or sell different products or services. This becomes a question of process standardization vs process harmonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process standardization means making one process for one job and keeping it the same, no matter where you use it. Obviously, this won’t work if you need to work across different countries or navigate different regulations. Process harmonization, then, is about setting a standardized core, but allowing for subtle changes as and when to accommodate for different use cases and scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decoding UI/UX - Quick comparison of Tinder and Bumble]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am back with another App Vs. post, this time around dating apps, that people majorly use here in India.

Why ? Because most of my single friends (sigh) are using them, and TBH I have admired the amazing gaming swiping technique that Tinder launched with, making search comparatively easy and without that dreaded feeling of getting rejected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided I will pen down my thoughts and analyse the two apps - &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinder.com/?lang=en&quot;&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bumble.com/en-in/&quot;&gt;Bumble&lt;/a&gt;, both having a large user base in India (Both rated 3.4 stars on the Google Play Store). I wanted to keep this simple, so didn’t include other popular apps like OKCupid (Rated 3.8 stars) or Happn (Rated 4.0 stars) here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinder is the most popular dating app in India, almost synonymous to online dating and is well-known for providing users to search for single individuals near them by swiping left or right. Bumble is an app that’s not only for dating (although we are going to focus on that in this article), but it’s also a platform for platonic friendships and professional communication, which is known across the world as a “feminist dating app”, where for heterosexual matches a conversation only starts when women take the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Problem Space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started off with the goals and did a quick research on why people may be using dating apps by talking to my friends and conversations/people they’ve encountered on these channels -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find love&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Casual hook-ups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find people to hang out with&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kill time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find followers for Instagram account (Tbh, it works)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each of the listed goals above, there’s a specific app existing today yet people continue to go on dating apps, to achieve all of these goals at one single place. Specifically Tinder, as Bumble has segregated the apps into - &lt;strong&gt;Bumble Date, Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz&lt;/strong&gt;, assuming that these may be the major goals people have while wanting to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deepdive into design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Login and Registration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Tinder and Bumble offer a very easy and simple onboarding process with minimalistic design and isn’t overwhelmed with a lot of UI elements. Of course, there are some variations in how the user flow will be like in both the applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Tinder starts off by sharing a basic guidelines or “House Rules” while using the app in the immediate screen itself after logging in, whereas Bumble decides to do this as the last step of onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinder and Bumble both collect basic information like Name, DOB, Gender, Sexual orientation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Bumble and Tinder go the additional step of giving the option to choose from the whole spectrum of gender identities while choosing how to identify oneself. Tinder also provides the option to choose upto 3 types of sexual orientation, something which is absent in Bumble - Men/Women/Everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinder also uses active wording like - “My first name is …”, that helps create some kind of conversation with the user.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Setting up a profile&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While setting up your profile you need to upload a photo for your profile, and in case of Tinder you need to add a minimum of two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tinder, what I found truly annoying about the process, was that you had to upload the photo it had to be in your recent photos OR you could snap a photo from your camera right then. It didn’t have the option to go to your gallery and choose a photo, and as a user you feel restricted, as you have to scroll down, assuming you have a good photo lying down somewhere in your recent photos (As a person, who has hundreds of photos of her cats and maybe only 1-2 of my face, setting a profile on Tinder took some time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/baebb553e700f82b620a76e3bbe89f98/d.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Scrolling photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bumble has all the necessary functionalities I would expect while uploading a photo or basically any file into the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Tinder asks you to choose a maximum of 5 passions from the list present to match you better with people sharing similar interests (I think). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step in onboarding is Tinder asking you if you want to avoid someone on Tinder by sharing your contact list, so both parties will not be able to see each other on the app. Pretty handy feature, if you don’t want to see a family member or an ex on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since both the apps are location-based, they ask permission to access your location as the final step before getting in the swiping game. Note the wording in Tinder, the grey button stating “Tell me more” leads you to the other screen.There Tinder explains why you should enable the location in terms of your benefits — that’s how you will see matches nearby. Interesting way to get permission, let’s allow it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Welcome Onboard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the apps give me a quick, interactive tutorial where I can see the card of my first potential match. Most of the card’s place takes the person’s photo. That’s the right way to attract any person’s attention. People evolutionally tend to notice and recognize other peoples faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/f505e2caf23eda32fe9cb25941c8fc8f/d0.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Swiping left right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinder’s match card design is pretty simple - photo, name, age, one-line description and/or a verified badge, passion tags. And if you scroll down the card, you see additional information like location, kilometers away from you, Spotify interests, Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas, Bumble’s match card is even simpler - photo, name, and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you tap the card you see the next tutorial — how to interact with the card. Nice timing to show it — right when I would need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sad thing, is you can’t undo your actions (unless you have a premium account), so if you swipe left a person that person is gone forever, and since this swiping activity is similar to scrolling Facebook/Instagram, you will have a fair idea of how you get hooked on it, and are mindlessly swiping people left/right, increasing the chance to make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can share the match profile with your friend to know their opinion. Very interesting idea on Tinder — when making a decision people are more likely to look for help from others. Also, it’s a good way to get your users to promote your app with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once the pairing is successful, you go to the next level and start chatting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Inbox&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a female, my Bumble inbox is less clutter-y and filled with random DMs as compared to my Tinder Inbox. Tinder has also started off a new feature called “My move” - giving women that extra layer of security that allows them to start a conversation with a man, although it isn’t turned on by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chatting, Bumble helps break the ice by providing random questions to ask another or just start off by saying a simple Hello through a funny GIF, to help make conversations easy. It has additional features of taking snaps, sending voice notes, starting a phone call/video call, without having to exchange phone numbers with each other. Bumble will also ask the user if they are willing to accept it, so the user will not be harassed and will not receive strangers’ photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinder’s messaging channel is a bit limited here. The only options here are sending a normal text, GIF, starting a video call, which is weird to me. It’s like the app wants the users to shift to other messaging channels, other than Tinder’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Profile and filters&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the rise of catfishing incidents, it’s nice that both these apps restrict users from allowing someone else’s photos. To be verified, the apps will ask you to take a photo of yourself and analyse it with facial recognition to ensure users are loading their own photos to the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Bumble, you can exclude people who do not meet your desired criteria, such as height, zodiac star sign and much more things. Tinder doesn’t have this, which is why Tinder’s large user base can be a disadvantage, as more than half the time gets wasted on filtering matches that are not suitable for you. This is a big drawback for a user who is usually busy with work or other daily errands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extra thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinder has definitely solved the pain points of modern people’s social lives, and optimized the UX of online dating apps, making the process super simple and fun, but it wastes a lot of time. Bumble goes an extra step here, with their filters, but, can it be better? Can a dating app offer a more meaningful experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Tinder doesn’t know what happens after a match happens. I mean, of course assuming they have the textual data upto a  certain point, but they don’t know what happens next - If a meeting happened, was it good. And how can it be done without violating privacy ? By asking the user for their feedback, like after-match. May be an annoyance if you think about it, but maybe there’s a simple solution there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Conducting gap analysis within HR - A four-step template]]></title><description><![CDATA[Digital transformation is a journey that involves ideas and processes used to optimize an entire business ecosystem around digital…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/conducting-gap-analysis/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/conducting-gap-analysis/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is a journey that involves ideas and processes used to optimize an entire business ecosystem around digital technology and customer-centricity. What triggers the need for digital transformation ? Most often, it’s social and behavioral changes in society ; that is a starting point for measuring the need to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a company can start working on this, they must also understand how to cultivate the right talent, which holds especially true for a service company, where the employees are the valuable resources who drive the company. So it’s imperative to provide prospective talent with the right resources and opportunities, which is why we are going to focus on how to implement a digital transformation strategy for the HR department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating Digital Readiness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an integrated framework to conduct a gap analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop awareness of how other companies overcame challenges and obstacles and leveraged opportunities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop an integrated action plan for successful implementation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conducting gap analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gap analysis is an examination and assessment of your current performance for the purpose of identifying the differences between your current state of business and where you’d like to be. It can be boiled down into a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where are we now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where do we wish we were?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are we going to close the gap?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a great way to visual your data and show where your organization is struggling and thriving. In our discussion around the gap analysis template below, we’ll talk specifically about how a gap analysis can be used within the HR department; it can also be used for your entire business or for a single process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also sharing the link to the gap analysis template I was using, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnybw9dsfwkSYZn9I4yNBDic1C6tfxKQ09W_5vM3HE4/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four steps outlined in the template below will help ensure you know precisely what issues you’re facing and how to go about fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Identify the current state of your department&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may sound overwhelming, but bear with me. First, identify the priority of that plan by understanding the need of the department on a granular level, meaning understanding the processes/tools that are involved also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I worked on improving the processes of the HR department, and the first thing that I worked on was documenting and mapping all the processes that came under this department - Hiring, Compensation &amp;amp; Benefits, Attendance &amp;amp; Leave etc. These processes maps/ flowcharts helped in understanding the flow of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Identify where you want to be with your department&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This future goal is sometimes called a desired state or future target. In order to accomplish this, you’ll want to think about how you are doing today in your current state (from step one) and where you really want to be within a reasonable timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are doing a gap analysis within the context of your strategic plan, take a look at the targets on your plan. These targets may be three to five years out, which is ideal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are you with them? To answer that, go back to your current state areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the HR department project I worked on, I did a lot of external research to understand best practices, by talking to firms, reading Gartner, Forrester reports and also talked a lot with company stakeholders, to understand their viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Identify the gaps in your department&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve recognized where your organization is currently and where you want it to be in the future, it’s time to bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the chart above; the “gap” is the gray shaded area, which demonstrates the difference between where you are and where you want to be. When identifying gaps in your department, you need to ensure that your goal and your current state exist in the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if your future goal is a year out, you need to extrapolate your current state out for a year to see the appropriate gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to figure out why there is a gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be specific about the gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dig deeper and determine why this gap has occurred. Do this by asking questions—and questioning the answers to those questions—until the root causes of the gap become clear. You may have heard about asking “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/&quot;&gt;five whys&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/medicare/provider-enrollment-and-certification/qapi/downloads/fishbonerevised.pdf&quot;&gt;Fish bone diagram&lt;/a&gt;”, both are great tools to track down reasons for imperfections, variation, defects or failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:500px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Devise improvements to close the gaps in your department&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve discovered why the gap in your department is taking place, it’s time to figure out the proper course of action to close it. Use the following guidelines to ensure the improvements you come up with are solid:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base all improvements on the information you discovered while identifying the gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the cost of implementation for each solution. Perhaps you don’t have the capability to stop working with your current customers. Can you outsource the development of a new offering? Maybe partner with another organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify end dates when you’d like to have the gaps resolved. Without setting an end date for improving the customer experience, it may end up being overlooked or ignored. Set a completion date—even if it is years in the future—and then set milestones to ensure success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to follow up on the improvements. Otherwise, there’s a real risk that the solutions you’ve so carefully engineered will fall through the cracks. Also, be careful about trying to close too many gaps at once. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a content marketing strategy for B2B companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[For an early age SAAS startup, looking to raise awareness about their product and getting it in front of more relevant eyeballs is a…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/content-marketing-strategy-for-b2b-companies/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/content-marketing-strategy-for-b2b-companies/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For an early age SAAS startup, looking to raise awareness about their product and getting it in front of more relevant eyeballs is a challenge. Content marketing tactics play a huge role across the marketing funnel to generate paying customers. But tactics never work without a solid strategy. While working on the GTM strategy, having clarity on a granular level helped us come up with better solutions. So what should you focus on first before jumping straight into using these tactics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know your customer profiles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trivial, but essential, personas depict customer profiles whose opinion matters when you’re creating an article, podcast episode, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding your persona’s informational needs better, you will have the option to  help them with the content that they will want to read, watch, or listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going into a content marketing strategy, it’s better to set aside a few hours so that you and your team can create persona profiles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember! If you don’t have a product-market fit and customers, you will only end up assuming things (sure, there will be some of those but our goal is to bring some clarity in the matter). After some time, you will reevaluate them. It’s best to focus on closing first sales, testing out your hypotheses about who makes an ideal customer, and then moving onto a persona creation bit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the essential aspects for creating customer persona:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give it a name and demographic profile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Role in the organization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What organization do they work in &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Details of the organization (Industry, No. of employees, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pains that your product can remove&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain relievers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gain creators/ Value proposition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jobs to be done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the demographics element you can consider including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a decision-making status (Chief technology officer, Head of HR)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;size of the organization (you target B2B customer is a company with 200+ employees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;location (you want to focus on Asians or specifically Indians)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;industry (your leads are tech companies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no one-fits-all solution, and you can have different criteria than those mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An even better approach is to create personas for people involved in the B2B decision making unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Converting MQLs to SQLs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two lead stages are usually misused and misunderstood, and companies tend to reach out to customers too early in the process when they’re not ready to discover sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is a typical scenario of the company reaching out too early to their leads:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A contact subscribes for a webinar series and watches a webinar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the webinar, a sales rep reaches out to a lead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales prequalify a user and initiate contact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sales rep tries to sell a product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lead usually rejects an offer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lead rejects the offer, and your sales or marketing assigns a lead to a nurturing campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though sales can potentially reach out to people with an urgent need that your product can satisfy, this is still too costly and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see an alternative scenario: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lead subscribes for a webinar series and watches a webinar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lead sees a retargeting ad on Google and Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lead starts to interact with educational blog articles and download some ebooks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lead receives some nurturing emails with value, not sales.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He then read case studies and your services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He can compare your solutions to competitive services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He wants to schedule a call or buy right away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sales rep talks to a problem and solution-aware prospect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rep qualifies a lead as an opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having leads initiate contact by themselves results in sales calls that convert better. Instead of pushing your offer too early, nurture the interest of your leads..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we understand how to convert more MQLs into SQLs, let’s first examine a digital marketing funnel and how contacts move through its stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stages in a B2B sales funnel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the core stages of the B2B sales funnel you need to know to better understand your customer buying journey:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1) Problem identification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The customer has a job to be done and needs to resolve a challenge connected with their role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;em&gt;A startup founder is looking to develop a SaaS tool and has doubts about what tech stack to choose. Customers are researching topics like “Top 10 popular frameworks for building an enterprise app&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2) Solution identification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the content from the problem identification stage, you have built awareness about your prospects’ problem. Now show them the potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;em&gt;You are selling computer software specializing in Node.js. Present this tech stack as the perfect way to companies that can use it to build their next app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3) Consideration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consideration stage occurs when your MQLs are researching your company. This is the time when you should be presenting an expert image of yourself by creating whitepapers, guides, ebooks etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prove your potential customers you have extensive experience and that you are reliable  by showing them your case studies and testimonials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;em&gt;A startup founder knows that Node.js is a perfect tech stack for building his app. He looks for different vendors and makes a list. Having come upon a great customer story of one dev shop in Poland, he decided to book a call to discuss the project details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4) Decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your lead needs to make a final decision and choose you among a list of other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;em&gt;A startup founder has met a CTO of one of the dev shops which portfolio he liked. It turned out the dev shop could meet all expectations and had sufficient experience to perform the job. Having evaluated different sales materials, they are now ready to make a choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important thing to keep in mind is that leads can join your funnel at any stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, they might be looking for vendors (consideration stage) when they enter your page; that is why you have to ensure they can easily find a contact form and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improving buyer’s journey process - Revamp website&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure and strategy for lead nurturing and lead scoring depends on a company’s growth stage. Lead scoring isn’t equally important for every stage of the company’s development. For an early stage start up this often involves seeking product market fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For companies in the early stage of seeking product-market fit, lead scoring isn’t usually a top priority. If you generate just a few leads daily and you have capacity to follow up on each and every lead, the importance of prioritization is greatly reduced. However, even at an early stage, it is beneficial to implement some very basic lead and user tracking system. By doing this, you can collect information on what journeys your prospects take before they buy. This means that when your company moves to the growth stage you have a few months/years of data ready to optimize your lead scoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure how your web page users’ behavior helps increase buyer intent, you have assumed your high-converting pages. For example, almost all of your leads who have visited a case study end up becoming your paying customers. In this case, you have to give a lead that has hit any of the portfolio pages more points. There is also a possibility there are some pages that disqualify your website users from becoming a customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some pages for which you can assign points for visiting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;portfolio pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;services pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pricing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bottom of the funnel content (e.g., specific articles)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pages with product testimonials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;contact page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working on a scoring system, one needs to assess historical data by first pulling it from different sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have your strategy in place, you need to define how you will nurture leads so that they interact with your content more, and you can qualify them as hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mistakes with lead generation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think things are easy from first sight. However, once you get down to execution, you might notice some things are not working the way you expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, you have sketched a general strategy, made assumptions, and set your success metrics. However, a “brainy” plan can still fail. Let’s see what works and what doesn’t- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Vanity metrics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have just written an article and shared it with your audience on social media. It got fantastic traction and engagement. You feel terrific with five-digital numbers and are waiting for your sales to explode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once you take a look at your goals in Google Analytics, you notice that nothing has been accomplished, and your article has not converted visitors in SQLs. There are at least two things that contribute to vanity metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Badly optimized content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have created a social media post but have not placed a relevant link that would lead your customers to the next step in the funnel. As a result, they have consumed content but haven’t taken the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Reaching the wrong audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have reached people who like to click but never buy. For example, one could write something that would appeal to a junior professional in a corporation rather than a person in a managerial position – a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, you have generated interest but from the wrong people with the wrong content. Thousands of views mean nothing if you can’t make an impact on moving leads closer to the conversion point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;No traffic&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have built a fantastic strategy, but you haven’t attracted enough traffic to the page. You can not achieve conversion with too little audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might be a reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;your content has not got traction yet, and it takes time to start ranking on given keywords in Google&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;your domain authority and backlink profile are low&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you have just bought a domain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you don’t supplement your organic reach with paid ads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, no one is visiting your website and goes through your beautifully designed funnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Average content&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user attention span has been decreasing over the years, but the amount of content on the Internet has increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t count on getting traction on traffic and leads if your content is bland, unoriginal, written by a content writer that bases his research mostly on a couple of blogs available online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, have your content written by a tech writer who incorporates case studies, unique fundings, and makes content engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Don’t expect overnight success.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing your domain authority, getting traffic, creating, and optimizing your content takes time. Treat this adventure as a marathon, not a sprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, create separate marketing campaigns with milestones, success criteria, and deadlines. This approach will help you move to your results in a consistent manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now you understand how things work from a strategic point of view. In another post, I will finally dive deeper into tactics –  methods to execute your strategy and talk about lead generation tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Improving Vested - UX Case Study]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Quick Brief Intro Vested wants to empower users who want to invest in the US stock market in an easy and safe manner.

They have built an investing platform for new and expert investors alike, that lets you buy and sell stocks, exchange-traded funds and Vests (curated portfolios for different risk types) all commission free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to conduct a two-week case study to enhance the Vested Android experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR — As a user of Vested, I wanted to learn if there were any usability problems that could be fixed. Through research, I was surprised to identify three pain points that most users were experiencing. I then prototyped my solutions and validated them with user data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goals for this project were to :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider UX methods to uncover user problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come up with solutions based on observable data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prototype and test solutions to enhance the UX while using Vested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Starting with UX research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to use Guerrilla usability testing, with the limited amount of resources I had with me. According to a study, it is estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/&quot;&gt;testing with just five users will reveal 93% of what can be discovered in a product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I performed a usability test with 6 people and asked them to perform specific tasks to test the core functions of Vested like - “You were referred to Vested from a friend of yours. Please show me how you would go about buying a share of Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also surveyed with 26 additional people (n=26) to gather more information about the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Guerilla Usability Findings&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that 50% of the users tapped on the non-interactive chart to find more information. They wanted additional data like numbers, percentages wrt the 2D chart present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Survey Findings&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For new investors (especially), additional resources were specifically asked for as a feature to make better decisions while choosing Vests. Around 65% users wanted to save the data for doing independent analysis on the performance of stocks/vests.
A whopping 78% users felt that the app had unnecessary features like “Referrals” as a main feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Main User Stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a user,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can only see a simple 2D chart, where I cannot even zoom into specific details. I would like to see some specific instant data from the charts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would like to analyse and compare the vest’s performance, by myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would also like to have more aid to help me choose and buy a Vest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My solution is to increase the clarity of navigation. I accomplished this by bringing a pop-up feature, with return percentage values of Vest and S&amp;amp;P500, when user hovers over the line charts. I also introduced a pinch-to-zoom gesture to zoom in and out of the chart (which was missing from the existing app). As you can see, I have also changed the background layout of charts to be consistent with the rest of the app, which wasn’t initially as it may not have a fully functional dark mode setting despite claiming to have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have introduced time period options to be selected by the user to check performance, as I noticed this feature is present across ALL the other investing apps in the market (during my short competitor research stint), leading me to conclude that it’s a necessary feature. Here’s a before-after comparision -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/H5gls1d&quot;&gt;BEFORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/7etbUIb&quot;&gt;AFTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also added a link to download data of Vest and S&amp;amp;P500, in form of a .csv file, as I believe that option will be useful by experienced users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, in my opinion having a “Referral” feature in the main menu really bugged me in the existing app, as I believed it wasn’t in sync with what users found useful and it wasn’t very relevant to the app’s offering so I went back to the users I tested with and asked about their opinion on this and they agreed that “Watchlist” was a more useful feature they would like to see on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed refining my design methods through this case study and I had fun uncovering ways to improve Vested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create the best PRD document (with examples)]]></title><description><![CDATA[The number one goal of a Product Requirements Document is simple: it must define the product’s purpose above all else.

Why is this product being released versus something else? What problem does it solve for end users? Why should the team care at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PRD keeps everyone on the same page which is why the content/structure of a PRD may vary across companies.I have found that each company uses a different format, and some are just simply a wall of text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Writing  a Product Requirements Document&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering all the requirements requires doing some research and dedicating a certain amount of time to it. The process includes studying your customers, competitors, as well as the potential of your team and technologies. Getting all of these information involves different teams, like Customer Success, Sales, etc. and lots of meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, I have tried to structure a PRD based on best practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Defining purpose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting product features &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determining technical requirements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preparing UI/UX definitions (mock ups, interaction definition, empty states, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;QA acceptance criteria (one or two paragraphs usually complementing the bigger picture for QA tests)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next steps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Best Practices for Writing a Product Requirements Document&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Write from the user’s point of view&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe the requirements from the user’s perspective. For this purpose, think of use cases and roles to describe your product requirements. Design Thinking may help in understanding the problem by putting yourself in the user’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use screenshots&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good practice is to use screenshots, layouts, or schemes to explain what is exactly meant. When it comes to a PRD, one screenshot is better than a long textual detailed document. Put as many screens/mockups as possible, helps people understand &amp;amp; capture what you are saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Write in simple and unambiguous words&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are writing a PRD for your colleague from the team of developers. Your goal is to provide clear explanations about the requirements, so that he can create a product meeting these specifications.Break long sentences into shorter ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use templates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PRD template can be really useful since it provides many advantages. First, templates use a standard form for the document, which makes the life of the development team much easier. Using templates also gives confidence that you have not forgotten to describe all aspects of your PRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Prioritization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of a full-scale project, it might be hard to implement all the functions that were described in a PRD at the same time. That is why the author of a PRD must give developers the ability to decide which features are of higher priority and which ones can be postponed if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, you can prioritize requirements by following the MoSCoW rule - must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and will not have at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Describe “What” and “Why” instead of “How”&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, it is the product manager who is responsible for setting out user requirements, as well as what and why it needs to be developed. As mentioned above, describing “how” may negatively influence the creativity of the development team. So it is advisable to avoid writing in-depth instructions on how to implement each requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Review and update&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not treat a product requirements document as a set of strict rules. Instead, be open and always ready to update your PRD with the suggestions from your colleagues. This approach will help you improve the document, and your team will be able to create better products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Describe your target audience and niche positioning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great requirements doc should describe the target audience and product positioning. Such information helps developers and other team members to introduce end-users and, as a result, create more successful products. It doesn’t have to be very detailed - just a few paragraphs will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PRD examples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now here is the list of PRD documents that I found (I will continue adding new documents when I find them, so do share if you find something interesting). Most of these are sourced from one person or were available on the internet which means a lot of it was customized for their own teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/19S9Nnb5kAiQiTtVFHkoGAwYt8dWUPH3bj62pcHc50mw/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/197Y75hLH9gHRa6EaNhm_Njsari1NFqxJDT5wai98d-4/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coda.io/@yuhki/figmas-approach-to-product-requirement-docs/prd-name-of-project-1&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fpe09AgKYHmqJJpEe_tyMGv8X412Cta5zL7Yuqmm9po/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Gojek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vciNUuM6WEC_93VgGHE68XN9cXDxzVoXg2X9WYSvJ4g/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ebs1vnLNlo0IoSHfKVV5_9_egPFlY_DLgw06HcMVsA8/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Lynda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnKBARQUfL1LNdmKZKU64j39xsF31VKaVpFliYZg8Zo/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://almanac.io/docs/template-product-specification-from-a-lyft-pm-a7f67b9767a99f96182d21dd9bd29318&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/115Y-ULG640Eni4OD0_mMxsYPrBL08KMwUUdceQKbExk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haVxGflbdR5b6glTmRuKmI8c9r-9xp-vENU9i5kHsjA/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;PhonePe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OyorJ9hu8tU-EmLVpICRPvi_rBR-3G0TzKZGuH9otuU/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFvwhOuK8JAIwPL3TyyP3kY25Iy90Bd-nWD44CBpCO4/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Seatgeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mwvcbF57E3qSkCnesrFN4rFYaOeWnmQVstRvMhbAICw/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRVnnNA3-aVYqONDbNCUPVj1kY-Ku1ru0CRtPa6iF68/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to redesign a B2B Saas website]]></title><description><![CDATA[A business website has the potential to generate a significant amount of traffic with content marketing and paid channels.

That is why you decide to redesign the page or slightly tweak some elements to squeeze more of your page traffic. In the redesign process, you need to account for a lot of aspects to ensure your page finally starts to convert at a higher rate. In this article, I will show you the roadmap for redesigning a SaaS website to reach a higher conversion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started by defining what makes a great B2B SaaS design, before approaching the page redesign process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpscout.com/&quot;&gt;Helpscout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proof uses numbers to show the result new users can achieve with the tool. The page includes two calls to action, giving users a choice to either explore the functionalities or book a demo right away. Further down the page this SaaS presents success stories of their customers helping instantly build trust with new page visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What makes a great SaaS design?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, the design of SaaS pages mentioned above (and many more) have a lot in common – it’s minimalistic, intuitive, and includes modern geometrical elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore some examples of SaaS pages that can serve a good example for SaaS page industry standards for 2021 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what is a standard in the SaaS industry, let’s see what it takes to get to the end effect – a better converting and aesthetically pleasing SaaS sales page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When thinking of redesigning your SaaS website, you have to start with the foundations – research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to understand what needs to be fixed on your page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your users need to easily find the necessary information on your new website. By looking into data, you can build assumptions about what blocks users from reaching their goals, what they expect from the page, and what annoys them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a set of tools at your disposal to gather information and build assumptions about what needs to be changed on your SaaS sales page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look into these two crucial types of research you can make – qualitative and quantitative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is qualitative research and how to use it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research helps identify the reasons behind users’ behaviour. This type of research includes usability tests and heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools will help you identify how your users interact with the page and understand why they are interacting with the page in this way and not the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Heatmaps in SaaS web page redesign&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Heatmap of website&quot; title=&quot;Heatmap of website&quot; src=&quot;/static/22ca63e87524d53f86c2cc4ff2eb56f6/1c72d/s47.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;/static/22ca63e87524d53f86c2cc4ff2eb56f6/a80bd/s47.jpg 148w,/static/22ca63e87524d53f86c2cc4ff2eb56f6/1c91a/s47.jpg 295w,/static/22ca63e87524d53f86c2cc4ff2eb56f6/1c72d/s47.jpg 590w,/static/22ca63e87524d53f86c2cc4ff2eb56f6/212bf/s47.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, by analyzing heatmaps, you can understand where a user spends more time on the page. Heat maps can help you identify if your users read the whole page or just 15%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may lead you to making an assumption that your users don’t find the rest of the page interesting. You can consider moving the most important information to the top of the page and cut your copy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Usability tests in webpage redesign&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability tests are the tool SaaS businesses can use to evaluate the webpage they create with real users before a design sprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will help you understand how users interact with your page, how they perceive its different elements (structure and copy), and most importantly, why they interact with the page in their particular way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When conducting usability tests you have to set clear goals of what exactly you want to learn about user interaction with your page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you want to identify if users can easily find something in the menu or on the main page. By asking them to perform some actions, you will understand if this is easy for them to find the necessary information on your page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is quantitative research and how to use it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative research helps you analyze a big amount of data and understand how all page users interact with your SaaS page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that quantitative research won’t tell why users behave in a particular way. Instead it will present your with a bigger picture of what users do on your page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct this type of research you can use web analytics, surveys, and funnel analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you have analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data, you can make assumptions about where users get stuck and identify reasons for your page underperformance and low conversion. With this analysis in place, you now can make assumptions about how your new page should look to better satisfy user needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Navigation for SaaS pages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The navigation of SaaS business pages is different from other industries. SaaS pages focus on presenting the main elements of SaaS software – app’s functionalities and integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When marketing a complex SaaS tool, you might find the process of creating your page navigation overwhelming. What if you have 20 different features and need to show your users all of them at the same time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including too many different features in the menu can overwhelm a user as well! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more complex features can be organized into clusters – segmented by solutions, customer profiles, or industries. The SaaS tools such as Hubspot have found a way to present the features to their users in the main navigation menu by simply grouping features for their main target groups – marketing, sales, and customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complex navigation menu can result in users clicking through multiple pages and spending more time looking for the features they need. Time spent on your page doesn’t really matter as long as your page converts well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Copywriting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before submitting a brief to designers, you should have a functional copy for your SaaS page. The amount of text and its structure can significantly affect the design. That is why your designers will require a finished version of the copy they could use in their design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the best practices of web copywriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing copy to a web reader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users consume information on the web in a different way compared to reading physical books or magazines – they read by skimming and scanning copy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never understood why some tech businesses decide to go with a long pitch for their main page. In my opinion, it makes it cluttered, difficult to read, and boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While longer copy might be a good idea for email sequences (still, run A/B tests to make sure it works for your SaaS!), the main page is not the right place to keep a user reading for ages before understanding your offer and value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include shorter paragraphs and actionable headlines. Explain your value proposition and present reasons to believe on the first screen (above the fold area).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using value language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid using fluff language and talk too much about your brand. I would cut down on the phrases “we”, “us”, and “our company”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A user doesn’t care about your business, but has their pains, problems and challenges to solve.These are the areas you have to focus on. Paraphrase your “we” sentences in “you” sentences and try to emphasize more with a user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show the benefits of how your solution can help solve problems. Avoid long introductions and setting up the scene – get down to the core of users’ challenges and present solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short actionable headlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each section of your main page and feature pages should include headlines that would make it easier for a web user to find the right information fast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t write generic headlines that would mean nothing.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, on your main page include case studies showing numbers “How XX increased conversion on the page by 20% within 3 months”. Numbers are attractive and help present the end result in a measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show your business statistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have some achievements you can brag about, expressing them in numbers. For example, a customer support tool can show the statistics of their agents speaking 40 different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have decided to write a new copy for your page, consider delegating this work to a professional copywriting who has worked on writing the SaaS page copy before and can deploy their knowledge and experience to your SaaS from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Wireframes and usability tests in SaaS design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping to the design phase of your page, you should first understand what users need to find on the page and how they will interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireframes represent a structure of your website and help define the elements that have to appear on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With wireframes, you can easier introduce changes and prevent burning budget. Before moving wireframes to the design stage, you should test them with real users. By sticking to a lean design framework you will be able to adjust your website to the needs of your users and meet their expectations better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just imagine building a page, investing all your budget in it, and see users complain about not finding or understanding the value that your business represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing wireframes, you can work with a UX strategist or designer who would be able to prepare a plan and implement the project with wireframing tools such as Figma, InVision, or similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have wireframes designed and approved, you can run usability tests with users and gather their feedback. Then, you can iterate on the wireframes (depending on how many iterations you are able to make) and slowly move to a design phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.  Preparing a design project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have gone through the four steps mentioned above, you can be sure your page structure is aligned with your clients’ expectations. Now, it’s time to put your validated idea into action. Let’s get down to the design process!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing a designer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have some time and prefer to coordinate the design process on your own, you can do your research and run interviews with the designers from the portals such as Dribble, Behance, and some freelance marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you value your time and don’t want to go through trial and error, you should work with an agency to help you run this process from A to Z. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need a few recommendations of great designers or help with running the design process, hit me with a message to get recommendations for the best designers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling in a brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When starting work with a designer you should fill in the brief. Having worked with different designers, I have recognized not all of them require clients to fill in the brief. Unfortunately, getting too little information about the project in the beginning can lead to many misunderstandings with a client and usually rounds of reworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By writing a brief a client can define his requirements better. Filling in the brief is some kind of thinking process you have to go through to make your goals a bit more specific. In the brief, you can also mention some examples of designs that you like and want your designer to use in the concept phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, depending on how many corrections you want to run with a designer, you run a design-feedback cycle to finally receive your project files and implement it on your page.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to price your SAAS product - An analysis of the top 100 SAAS companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are a lot of best practices for SaaS pricing pages out there, with giants like  HubSpot ,  Snowflake  being the authorities.

Recently, I was working on changing our pricing strategy and landing page strategy,  for which I though of looking at experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SaaS pricing page is usually the final factor in the decision chain whether to buy your product or not. That’s why you should pay a lot of attention to it and optimize it to get more conversions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the best way would be to look at the pricing pages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#4632170c5f94&quot;&gt;The Cloud 100&lt;/a&gt; — a list compiled by Forbes of the most successful SaaS products in the world. It’s safe to say, then, that this group knows a thing or two about growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see this data in the form of an infographic, you can skip straight down to the bottom on this page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is quite a bit of data here so this is a overview of insights I found from this study, which will be easier for you to get some perspective -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average number of packages was 3.5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 10% of the companies recommended their highest package as the best option&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;72% companies listed their packages from Low to High&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;76% companies sell their benefits on page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most common CTA was “Try for free”, followed by “Contact Sales”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;82% companies had a contrasting CTA color&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;64% companies offer a free trial with the most common trial duration being 30 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;94% companies had named packages, with the most common names being “Free, Pro, Enterprise” etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50% companies offer a freemium model for their services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;74% companies have their pricing details publicly available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;36% companies had a detailed feature table in their pricing pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a more detailed dive into the study to understand the commonalities among the best SaaS pricing pages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Average number of packages was 3.5&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My results show that the most common number of packages found was 3 and 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain can’t comprehend a lot of options. Research shows that it’s better to provide just &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/stylumia/the-magical-number-7-2-how-to-grab-attention-8864e0f5592b&quot;&gt;7 ± 2&lt;/a&gt; options (5-9 rule) at a time, as humans are able to retain only about 7 things at a time in their short term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple is better here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Only 10% of the companies recommended their highest package as the best option&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;SaaS pricing pages highlight one particular package as the best option and they often leverage the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cobloom.com/blog/saas-pricing-models&quot;&gt;Center Stage effect&lt;/a&gt;” in some form to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pipedrive.com/&quot;&gt;Pipedrive&lt;/a&gt; has a clear, effective application on their pricing page and their “Pro” plan has a “Most Popular” label, and the columns are slightly offset from the others to further highlight it. The way Pipedrive highlights their middle option is interesting, and well designed : &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;72% companies listed their packages from Low to High&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;People normally read from left to right, as we expect prices to escalate from left to right. When prices are unevenly displayed, it can throw us off, so this is purely from a UX point of view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts argue though, that one should put prices from High to Low. High-low pricing uses price anchoring to leverage sales, as the product value is associated with the original “premium” price, so when a discount is applied, people think it’s a great deal (similar to what happens in retail industry).

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Most common CTA was “Try for free”, followed by “Contact Sales”&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your calls-to-action should be in bold colors so that they’re easy to read. The most popular CTAs were, in order  :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try for free (26%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact Sales (18%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sign Up (12%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a Demo (10%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others including Buy Now, I’m interested etc. (34%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there’s definitely an increase in companies who have started providing a free trial option to their services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/product&quot;&gt;Notion’s&lt;/a&gt; pricing page :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, startups seem to be pushing self-service free trials instead of demos with sales staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;82% companies had a contrasting CTA color&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining what color combinations can be used to match a company’s branding and create the psychological triggers necessary to convert an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Unbounce, a rule of thumb for CTA color is to “look for the dominant hue of your page and pick its contrasting color for your call to action”, which is what most Saas companies are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a weird example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amplitude.com/&quot;&gt;Amplitude&lt;/a&gt;, chose not to highlight their Free plan’s CTA with a contrasting color, so when you open the page for the first time, you’re going to look at the two “Contact Us” options because they stand out. Normally, when you have a “Free” plan, companies tend to use it as a top-of-the-funnel package to get leads from, but Amplitude wants to focus on the “Growth” and “Enterprise” plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;64% companies offer a free trial with the most common trial duration being 30 days&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering a free trial allows users to see the value of a service and to influence their buying decisions, while creating an urgency to purchase. Free trial is a lead generation technique that can be powerful for Saas software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sumologic.com/&quot;&gt;Sumologic&lt;/a&gt;, has a clear “Start 30-day free trial” CTA button, influencing people to try and understand all of their products features, giving user ample amount of time to reach that “aha!” moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;50% companies offer a freemium model for their services&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, 50% in the Forbes list operate on a freemium model, with the vast majority of the rest relying on free trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Weekly Growth, early stage SaaS startups are &lt;a href=&quot;http://weeklygrowth.com/saas-freemium-or-free-trial-complete-guide/&quot;&gt;best off with a freemium model&lt;/a&gt; because it is more likely to attract early adopters, Offering a freemium product opens up a business’s top-of-funnel much more than any trial or sales demo could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freemium is a good tactic for products with “rising consumption” like here, in the case with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/&quot;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

Yet, companies choose to have it included in their pricing pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at other companies, and they had additional information with their pricing and plans, like feature tables, sliding meter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pos.toasttab.com/&quot;&gt;Toast&lt;/a&gt;, they have an optional pop-up feature table along with the existing list of essential features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Difference between enterprise and startup SAAS pricing pages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking difference is that a SaaS startup is almost twice as likely to show its pricing than an enterprise SaaS company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, startups are more likely to have a mixture of priced and ‘contact us’ packages.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastering SEO optimization can be hard, especially if you’re just starting out. I started learning SEO and optimizing my website sometime in August, and I scourged SEO master blogs, reddit communities to come up with a list of free tools to get some hands-on experience and to also judge what works and what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I tried and tested the tools and then grouped them by categories. Personally, as a beginner, I do not believe you will be needing the odd 100 SEO tools of wildly varying quality, I see mentioned in comprehensive blog posts, I feel like 100 SEO tools is a ridiculous amount to process as a user. You will just need two or three really good tools to run an SEO experiment (I will write a detailed article on how to run an SEO experiment in a different article)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sharing the best SEO tools that are free but you will probably need to create account/login to access most of them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keyword Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a big proponent of using multiple keyword tools and using them synergistically. I do not believe in using just one tool, as together they help me generate content that I need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keywordtool.io/&quot;&gt;Keyword Tool&lt;/a&gt; -
This is great for discovering variations of keywords to build pages around. Frequently, I use this the most for developing content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keywordseverywhere.com/&quot;&gt;Keywords Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; -
The good thing is you won’t have to spend time searching and copying data from different sites, which is huge. You can also download your metrics as a PDF or Excel document for data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/features/keyword-research/&quot;&gt;SEMRush&lt;/a&gt; -
Pretty useful for generating competitive insights, even at domain-level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On-page SEO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technicalseo.com/tools/schema-markup-generator/&quot;&gt;Merkle’s Schema Markup Generator&lt;/a&gt; -
Luckily, one can implement structured data on your website at no cost (and with little technical know-how). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/seo-toolbar&quot;&gt;Ahrefs’ SEO Toolbar&lt;/a&gt; -
It generates an on-page SEO report for the visited page with important elements. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/blog/ahrefs-seo-toolbar-whats-new/&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Link Building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker&quot;&gt;Ahrefs’ Backlink Checker&lt;/a&gt; -
It shows the top 100 backlinks to any website or web page for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/link_building/&quot;&gt;SEMRush Link Building&lt;/a&gt; -
Can help anyone to find and acquire the highest quality relevant backlinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical SEO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/&quot;&gt;Screaming Frog&lt;/a&gt; -
Screaming Frog is a great SEO tool. Their free version offers a lot of great insights about specific sites and seeing what H1, H2 tags, Alt Tags, Meta Descriptions and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en&quot;&gt;Lighthouse Chrome plugin&lt;/a&gt; -
The most useful part of the tool is the number of technical issues and actions it highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; -
There is no other data source that provides high quality and detailed information like Google Analytics, this is a must.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to grow your instagram account organically]]></title><description><![CDATA[I spent a better part of 2020, on exploring my artistic side for which I created and promoted digital content on Instagram.

Now, I had a lot of time during the initial months so I spent those in perfecting my strategy to grow my account and I learnt that there’s a bunch of ways to grow an IG account, and a bunch of ways to tank one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post will be a summary of key factors I believed played a role in growing an account organically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;UNDERSTANDING THE AUDIENCE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super basic thing, but getting a professional account is needed, for tracking the key metrics that’s relevant to gauge the growth of an IG account. Other than IG Insights, there re a bunch of free IG tools that help ease this process like - Keyhole, Social Bakers, Squarelovin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really doesn’t matter all that much what you’re using your IG account for, whether it’s to sell a product, to increase brand awareness,or just to generate hype, it’s vital to understand your audience. For which, you should get an overview of the demographic makeup of the follower base (of course, this only plays a role after, you already have gained some followers to look into). It’s also necessary to keep an eye on what competitors with a similar target audience are doing - When are they posting ? Do they post captions ? If yes, is that one sentence or a paragraph? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really helps focusing on the most successful post of competitors and then breaking it down to understand the most probable reasons why that post worked so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO COME AT IT WITH A STRATEGY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to know something, just ask! Ask your existing audience about their favorite kind of Instagram content and the accounts they’re following. Ask them in your next Instagram post or Story, and wait for the useful insights to roll in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;INSTAGRAM ALGORITHM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt; : The IG algorithm changes every few months, so what worked last year or even last quarter, probably won’t work the exact same way now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, variables such as time of post, total likes and comments, hashtags, location, details on the account that posted, are used to boost or demote a post. What I saw specifically this year, is the role of the &lt;strong&gt;“SAVE”&lt;/strong&gt; option which is basically like a &lt;em&gt;Super-like&lt;/em&gt;. Same goes for &lt;strong&gt;“Share this post as a message or story”&lt;/strong&gt; feature, it holds a higher ranking than likes and comments, in the list of things that can increase a post’s engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;There’s a strong relation between “Saves” and the reach your post will have, as you can see. This is from a first-hand analysis of my own posts.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;POST FREQUENCY&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;TBH, I have seen varied advice on this. I don’t have the bandwidth to post daily so I post only once a week (DO NOT do this in the initial weeks/months of your new account,, it will slow down your growth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, posting once a day is a safe option.I’ve had success with even posting 3x a week. But make sure you aren’t oversaturating your feed. You can easily lose followers by making too many low quality posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality &amp;gt; Quantity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, learn to plan ahead, and try scheduling posts to be shared across the day/week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you don’t plan and just post everything at once, you’ll run out of content (talking from A LOT of personal experience), and that sure ain’t gonna bring you new followers. A fellow IG influencer friend of mine told me I should ideally create 50 art posts, in the initial days of my account, so that I will always have something in my back pocket, in case I fall short of content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TIME OF POST&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also depends on where your followers are. For me, 6pm-9pm IST , was the ideal time to post. This is also when most people tend to be on IG. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Sunday tends to be the least engaging day of the week, but I’ve still found plenty of success these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CONTENT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always tag people in your posts as well. So find influencers in your niche and tag them in the photo and/or the caption. Certain accounts likes have more value than others, so use this to your advantage. Find pages your audience follows, and tag them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, for these portfolio IG accounts, be aware of trends or challenges that’s going on so you can create content around these to reach a larger base. In 2020, I saw these trending #toonme, #mermay2020, #sailormoonredraw and of course #DIYchallenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fairly huge account, sometimes you can repost past posts, it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, post multiple photos with every post, even if they’re only slight variations. You want users to engage with your post, so if someone scrolls the other photos, then it basically tells the algorithm that its an interesting post. likes/engagement. Same goes for putting captions, I normally have seen putting long captions help, especially in videos, as users are looking at your post more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HASHTAGS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post your tags in your caption and not your comments. You can edit your caption and update your tags throughout the day. This boosts your post multiple times. Also use hashtags relevant to your niche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to choose hashtags ? I like to use the 25/5 strategy where I will use 25 hashtags under 100,00 and 5 over, or all hashtags under 100,000. This works for me, but there are other strategies too like 10/10/10 - basically means to use 10 big hashtags, 10 small, and 10 medium sized ones to properly market your post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing with hashtags is to keep experimenting and find what works. Not all posts are going to do well in a good set of hashtags, and not all good posts require a good set of hashtags to do well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, base your tags on what larger accounts in your niche are doing, then test + discover your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OTHER TOOLS BESIDES POSTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be things like Stories, Live, IGTV, Reels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post stories once a day or 5x a week, as a general rule of thumb. An easy strategy with stories is to just do reposts on similar accounts and encourage them to engage with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live feed maybe once or twice a week, or more, if you have the content/activity. Things like talks, walkthroughs etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely use Reels, I posted 2 reels with not so amazing content and they still managed to garner a lot of views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OUTSIDE ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your ultimate goal through organic growth is to consistently get on the explore page and get promoted this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where you’ll really separate your account and make huge strides in growth. You should be spending 30 mins to an hour a day, going out and liking and commenting on other people’s posts, to help drive engagement to your page. If you haven’t noticed by now, the key word in IG is engagement, and you have to give if you wanna get. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can open a post in the explore page or on any big account, like it, leave a comment that opens/starts a conversation, and move on in literally less than 10 seconds. Great, swipe right, and do it again. and again. and again for the next 30 minutes. I’ve seen this strategy work, but also doing this multiple times throughout the day. But don’t go overboard with it, there are limits to how much one can comment/like/follow in a specific time frame, otherwise IG will block that action temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also make sure that you’re replying to all your comments on your posts. This will not only increase loyalty and motivation among your followers, but also trick the algorithm. if you get five comments on a post, and reply to all of them, you now have 10 instead of 5. Always be engaging and active with your followers, and try to reach out to other accounts in your niche and bring them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;LIST OF DONTs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t buy followers. Most of them tend to be bots, or the wrong type of followers, and won’t engage with you at all. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget about it or give up. Stay consistent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t post just to post. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just in case, you want to go through my Instagram account, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/spongebobsquarepaints_/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a mindfulness product - Headspace]]></title><description><![CDATA[I discovered  HeadSpace  in my first semester of MBA, I remember feeling the need to search for this proverbial “escape door” from the sheer…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/headspace-app/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/headspace-app/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;HeadSpace&lt;/a&gt; in my first semester of MBA, I remember feeling the need to search for this proverbial “escape door” from the sheer amount of workload that I was consumed by, which led me to this. Although when I wanted to use the app (2018), I wanted to meditate for an hour but was restricted to a mere 10 minutes per day. Although I ditched the app then and there, this peculiar decision to restrict meditation sessions to 10 minutes was probably inspired by looking at earlier practices of users who possibly couldn’t afford to spend a lot of time on meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when 2020 arrived and the world collectively decided to wreck things up a little more, the mindfulness market grew to a $1.2 Bn market, and we saw a surge in meditation and mindfulness app downloads amid the pandemic. So given how great Headspace is doing in the market, I decided to understand the app better (and give it another go).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide some context here, Headspace is a guided meditation and mindfulness app, which has 10M + downloads on Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I do want to blab about how the app helps one achieve mindfulness, but I do want to focus more on the product management practices the company abides by (and hopefully learn something from it), so here’s a summary - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hassle-free and simple onboarding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any app that allows you to sign up in a single screen with minimal steps during form-filling gets a tick in my book. It gets to the point about what you might need from such an app and isn’t restrictive when it comes to the personal experience; you can answer a short series of nicely designed questions with large icons to personalise the experience from the very beginning, which leaves the first impression that you will get a great user experience out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Content is king&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headspace’s content marketing strategy is bang on! They have their own blog, a YouTube channel with many videos having 15M views and a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the app, the language feels safe, fresh and easy. Content in the app feels like you’re talking to that friend who gives you the advice you need, in a way that you can trust. An important lesson here is to know how your users talk and therefore how you should interact with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both in the app and outside, Headspace delivers what it promises on - &lt;em&gt;Making meditation simple&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on primary component&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has one key component - Tweets. It can add/remove other features, but tweets are an integral part of Twitter. For Headspace, this component is a small audio clip. After removing all the subscriptions, packages, designs, the only thing that matters is the guided meditation clip. This is a bit different from how people access content normally, most apps have text, picture, video or a combination of those, but in Headspace there’s only audio clips, which brings along a totally new dynamic on how users consume content and thus has been optimized in a unique way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t feasible to create content from scratch, which is where the expertise of Andy Cuddiombe’s (founder of HeadSpace) comes into picture. It’s interesting to know that Andy Puddicombe himself is a buddhist monk, having received his meditation training for more than 10 years in a few countries like Nepal, India, Burma, heartland of different branches of buddhism religion. He started his private meditation practice which subsequently led him to co-founding Headspace. Which is why the product is highly centred around this tested content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Achieving Design Zen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being an audio based product, Headspace’s UI is surprisingly visual. The interface is clearly kept to a minimum to keep things simple. The user interaction is intuitive and logical, where with a maximum of 3 clicks anyone can get into the desired section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Headspace’s greatest strengths is that it has a truly unique identity. It’s all been so well-considered from a design point of view; everything from the muted colour palette to the beautiful illustrations helps to communicate a distinctive and calming presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rewarding good habits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexandercowan.com/the-hook-framework/&quot;&gt;Hook framework&lt;/a&gt; ? Crafting fulfilling rewards for the users is no easy task. Gamification is used in all kinds of apps, but getting it right is extremely hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is something I believe is important and can be hard to achieve because there’s a really huge chunk of users who don’t meditate habitually and may require timely, impactful nudges to help them achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create scarcity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I presume that Headspace is spending its bucks on -  user activation - turning users to paid users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headspace attempts to improve daily user engagement through a gamified, free 10-day beginner exercise: it encourages you to take one short session every day for 10 days, stressing that regular practice is important.  Once the user has gone through Headspace enough, a user craves for more but now it comes with a paywall. By this time, Headspace has helped the user (hopefully) understand the value it can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep users engaged&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great way to get users to come back to the app — get them to add their friends to your app! Headspace lets you nudge your friends and keep them informed about your progress. Sometimes having a community can be the difference between a great and excellent app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw this is a newly added feature for group meditation , which drastically increases the sense of real time interaction with the couch as well as helps establish communities (it feels as if you are meditating with a group of people). Everybody wants to belong somewhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More research, less assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have an entire section dedicated to this on their website, to show you what their ongoing research has found and how they are striving to get better. They rely on data to make strong decisions. While this is a difficult task to achieve, Headspace seems to be doing a great job.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why can online advertising become the next internet bubble]]></title><description><![CDATA[Consumers may not like crappy ads (of which, there are plenty).

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers may not like crappy ads (of which, there are plenty). Consumers may not like it when their content is interrupted by ads (when will advertisers understand that pop-up ads are a nuisance for everyone). Advertisers may not like that consumers don’t “engage” with their ads. None of that really matters, as long as it works.  In 2018 $273bn was spent on digital ads globally. We delve into the world of clicks, banners and keywords to find out if any of it is real. But the question is - how effective is digital advertising ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that, let’s go back a little, to the world of traditional Tv advertising. The conventional wisdom says that it’s got to be effective otherwise why do brands spend a ton of money on these advertisements but the data tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubling the amount of advertising would lead to an increase in 1% of sales. (Meh, right?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objections that come up regarding facts like these are commonly - If you don’t advertise your product and your rivals do, then where does that leave you? So this turns into a Nash equilibrium thing where one makes an ad, and the other makes an ad too, making it a lose-lose situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was Tv advertising always so inefficient or did it lose its lustre with the arrival of digital giants like Google?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what I do know is that people are spending more time online (thanks to the pandemic) and that digital adverts hold the promise of matching advertisers precisely to the kind of customers they want to target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more relevant you’re to your audience, more interest there will be around the message you are trying to communicate, and the more likely they’re to buy your product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to cookies in your computer, you’re constantly telling companies exactly what you’re interested in. This is not new knowledge though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet has made it almost too easy to sell to us, and sell to us they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how Facebook and Alphabet have become two of the most valuable companies in the world. With so many advertiser’s spending billions, they must be getting healthy returns, right? Digital advertising must be effective, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Um, it’s difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads definitely work but from where I stand there’s no definite answer as to how or why they work, or  give you any evidence for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this experiment eBay did in 2011, where the questions around the efficacy of digital advertising actually started. Steve Tadelis was a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley and during one of his first conversations with eBay’s marketing team, they invited him to sit down with their consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what he learnt from the consultants, that the results  they were showing him was garbage. Correlation, as any Statistics 101 class will inform you, is not causation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do these impressive numbers mean if the people who see your ad are the exact same people who were going to use eBay anyway? eBay is no small fry. Surely lots of people looking for shoes end up on the online auction site all by themselves, whether they see an ad or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand keyword advertising, was eBay’s most successful advertising method. Buying brand keyword ads had the highest bang for the buck, which of course didn’t make sense from a common sense perspective because if I am already searching for eBay I know exactly where I wanna go so the fact that the ad intercepts me and I click on it is just coincidental and which cannibalizes what could have been a free click on the organic search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eBay renegotiated there deal with Bing to turn off their brand keyword advertising, as an experiment. Not surprisingly, all the search that was taken away from ads ended up coming for free from the organic search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is no competition for the keyword “ebay” and if we remove that ad, then the organic search is what the people are going to see firstly, so people will be going to ebay directly without eBay paying any fees to the search engine for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine Amazon enters into an ad auction for the keyword ebay and Amazon wins that auction. People will ignore the Amazon link and move on directly to eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So brand keyword advertising is a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For non-branded search, here if I am searching for “microphone” I will get a variety of results, and if ebay doesn’t pay for that ad, they may not even show up on the first page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another experiment, they targeted certain DMAs (Designated Market Areas) in USA where they turned off all their keyword search ads and measured actual sales. And surprisingly, the impact was pretty much zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertising works, we just don’t have much of an idea about how it works. Potential for digital advertising seems large given how it can micro target consumers. Targeting really is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do people ever see ads at all? A research study by Google says that close to 60% of the ads on the internet are never seen. The ads are delivered but it’s dumped somewhere in the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user cookies are unavailable ad revenues only drop by about 4%. Why? Possibly because people pay a lot less attention to online ads as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When banner ads were first launched on the internet their clickthrough rate was 50% and then it fell a lot and is now around 0.01%. Of course, there’s a challenge to accurately capture this - Like bots who click on the ads, Novelty wears off, habituation sets in - which is another problem of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/3a7fc57cb9dcd8964db9e02d6cad7922/b8.gif&quot; alt=&quot;South park run from ads&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People increasingly don’t want ads so they created ad blockers , whose adoption has increased rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital advertising is grotesquely overvalued because it is still so hard to measure. One reason why it’s so hard to measure is because the marketplace is vast and opaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of &lt;a href=&quot;https://catwomaniya.io/facebook-ads/&quot;&gt;advertising boycott&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook, Twitter and YT agreed to adopt a common set of definitions for hate speech and develop tools to let advertisers have more control over where their ads show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;G also ran an experiment where it cut its advertising spend to check its efficacy and what it found was that there was no noticeable impact over their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral advertising – in just the last few years – has been credited with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shifting the outcome of a presidential election.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building dozens of “unicorns.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping thousands more companies survive a once-in-a-generation pandemic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if online advertising may be a bubble, we know that this bubble deflation will leave a huge impact. Journalism is supported by ads. Google is supported by ads. Nearly everything else you see online and don’t pay for is supported by ads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital advertising is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, it is improving (mostly) over time – largely due to major ad tech platforms building better, more accurate, and more complete data sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read about the detailed story of Ebay’s experiment &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising/13228924500-22d5fd24&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. *&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to increase user adoption for your SAAS product]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a SAAS business, retaining and expanding revenue is critical to guaranteeing the health and growth of the company.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a SAAS business, retaining and expanding revenue is critical to guaranteeing the health and growth of the company. Increasing number of companies are investing in improving their customer experience as a way to help customers understand the value they provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part in this process of introducing an application to a customer, is adoption where they can see how to use it and see recurrent value from the product by really putting it in their routine.  This is where the CS team comes into play, they focus on supporting customers as they adopt, or onboard, the new product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fairly obvious way to do so, is by looking back at successful customers and identifying the steps they took. Similarly, look at the path churned customers took and identify what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be, for instance, identifying &lt;em&gt;“Customers who churned out had an adoption rate of less than 30%. They only used 20% of the features they should have been using at this moment of their customer life/they only used 45% of licenses or seats they bought”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s a plethora of things that can be done to ensure growth after the user starts using the product, it’s fairly difficult to get a user to know or even try your product, especially if you’re a small business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on this project in the past around optimization of HR processes in a company. This case is particular to getting employees to install the organization’s super-app (I gave the name) on their phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some context, the objective for building this mobile app was to - improve internal communication, boost employee engagement while improving any inefficiencies in the HR department. The Dev team and HR team had done a lot of internal research and worked brilliantly into designing the app, thoroughly thinking of the interface, features, user experience. The only issue that remained was that even after 2 months of launching the app, the adoption rate across the company was 37%. I wasn’t there for the actual execution of the project, but it gave me some understanding on how to improve user adoption rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to Onboarding :
The majority of customer churn is going to take place between two pivotal milestones:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While customer is signing-up for your product&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the customer achieves their first “success” with your product &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make your presence known&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know your audience well, like even know how they spend their daily routines, it becomes a little easier to generate awareness of your product.  For example, for the days before and during the launch of the employee app, the plan was to be present everywhere where employees normally spend their time -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posters with QR codes present in strategic locations where employees frequent everyday, like cafetaria, elevator, break rooms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blast out emails for the launch of the product&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posts sent on Communication channels with a direct link to the app or a QR code (Ex - Slack) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create personalized backgrounds advertising the product on video conferencing tools (Ex - Zoom etc.) (P.S. This is so relevant right now due to this enforcement of WFH)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will  always be some number of early adopters for your product. These are the people who want to be part of the community and can actually be the voice to raise interest about your product. To leverage this group of people, you can launch a &lt;strong&gt;referral program&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that there’s enough incentive for both the inviter and invitee to partake in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Onboarding is Much Like Marketing - Have a Story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In marketing, you’re taught the old adage ‘WiFM’, or ‘What’s in It For Me?’. Getting people to change their habits and embrace change is difficult. Learning a new process, a new software and how to work with people differently, is hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best way to help people to embrace change is to help them to understand how the change will benefit them.*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be able to position the value of the software in terms that each important audience can understand and get behind. Such as the employee app, the benefits of using the app was clearly communicated in simple language and was consistent across channels.  A lot of emphasis was made on add-on resources like how-to guides with lots of screenshots to explain certain processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Think Through the Support that Users Will Need&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SaaS, there are usually 2 primary support needs, Functional Support and Technical Support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional Support - Like creating dashboards that are meaningful and actionable for each important user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical Support - It can mean troubleshooting when things aren’t working properly. It usually incorporates implementation getting machinery connected. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the employee app case, there wasn’t either, atleast not a full-fledged team. The app was built in-house and it had a lot of integrations for various HR functions, to optimize the current HR process/system without forcing the user to shift to something entirely new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about how you’ll know if the roll-out is taking hold, to measure user adoption and roll-out success. Like gauging your progress and user satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are never going to onboard exactly how you planned; but focusing on their actual behaviors can dramatically improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Measure Product Adoption Rates
(Adoption rate : Ratio of new users of your product or the percentage of new consumers of a new feature of your commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Measure Product Adoption Rates
(Adoption rate : Ratio of new users of your product or the percentage of new consumers of a new feature of your commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about how you’ll know if the roll-out is taking hold, to measure user adoption and roll-out success. Like gauging your progress and user satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are never going to onboard exactly how you planned; but focusing on their actual behaviors can dramatically improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different types of adoption rates you can measure, with each one targeting a segment of consumer engagement with your product. However, three metrics stand out that helps you identify the success of your campaign. But I will be looking at how to calculate the adoption rate to provide a tangible result. So the three product adoption metrics are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adoption Rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time-to-first key action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Percentage of users who completed a primary action for the first time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decoding UI/UX - Quick comparison of Swiggy and Zomato]]></title><description><![CDATA[I'm a self-proclaimed designer.

(I started an IG channel, a Patreon account and a Behance account in the small span of 2 months after I created a realistic looking egg using illustrator)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the amateur artist persona aside, for a long time now, I have passionately looked at apps and asked questions around their aesthetics and usability, like - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is even the function of the “Inbox” tab option in Paytm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is Google Pay’s search button called “New payment” and why is it present at the bottom of the screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/94050ff05afad99047e47a85d528b961/bs6.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Thinking Batman&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so I decided I will pen my thoughts and analyse the two apps I have used significantly more since the lockdown happened - Swiggy and Zomato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiggy is primarily a food delivery app. Zomato offers the service of food delivery and restaurant discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about both these companies is that there’s been a lot of changes in how the app looks, even if I compare it with last year. They always continue experimenting with new designs and have improved the whole experience of ordering food, if we compare it with the past versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Problem Space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key point to consider here is to firstly understand the needs of the customers. From my understanding, the primary objectives to judge food delivery apps include -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good quality of food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels necessary to mention this here that I will only be talking about the design of the applications in food delivery space and not review their service, and will be doing so solely from the perspective of a user or food-eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UI Design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First annoying thing about Swiggy is you cannot enter the app unless your location is switched on. Belonging to the class of people who religiously adhere to good battery backup methods, being forced to do something is annoying, even if it’s turning the location on. Although, as a person who once had their food delivered to the wrong address by mistake, I think I understand where they’re coming from :3. There’s no two ways about this, it’s an inconvenience, even if it’s a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember the minimal, clean interface of old Swiggy. Since the past year/s, it has become very &lt;em&gt;Zomato-ish&lt;/em&gt; lookwise. The font size for restaurant names have increased, even text and pictures take up more space now. They still stick to their color scheme (more or less).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Zomato straight up goes to the home page. And it’s loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been some unmissable changes like how Zomato changed it’s menu listing so now it allows images to capture more space on screen as opposed to the previous list that looked similar to Swiggy. It does feel like a lot of clutter and color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the restaurant listed, they have labels on top of the image to explain - COVID-19 precautions adhered by restaurant and coupon codes for particular restaurants. I am unsure if labels were the best way to do so, and on top of it using contrasting color labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Swiggy, there’s a button for search at the bottom of the screen with the typical “Magnifying glass” icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you begin typing something in the search bar, it provides a list of my recent searches, which makes the experience more personalized and suggestions of popular searches in the area, which is great if I am unsure about what I want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One issue I did find is that since Swiggy ventured into grocery delivery, it lists the  grocery items and food items in the search results together,  which can be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zomato, the search bar is on the banner itself. Similar to Swiggy, it also provides a list of recent orders and popular ones in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed one thing here, if I enter &lt;em&gt;“Tomato”&lt;/em&gt; in the search bar, it will suggest picking a dish name from the list shown, like “Tomato Soup” and I can’t proceed further unless I pick something. This ignores the dishes which contain the word “Tomato” in their dish description, which Swiggy does pick up and provides a list of items that contain the search word, if it’s in the dish name or description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Menu&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both apps have a simple menu design, with a list of dishes with images and/or description mentioned, and also labels the “Bestseller” dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zomato also provides ratings on specific dishes.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Payment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zomato remembers the last used option and uses it as a default option, unless changed by the user, this does reduce the time in placing an order. Swiggy doesn’t do that and it directly provides you with a list of payment options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before finalizing the order, Zomato also provides suggestions to add to the bill based on popular add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Changes due to pandemic - Extra&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you open the Zomato app, there’s a large banner at the top that speaks in a large font - “Food Delivery is Safe”, assuaging our fears around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Zomato provides specific details about the guidelines a restaurant is adhering to, through labels, which makes sense as people also refer to Zomato before dining out and it provides details about a restaurant’s hygiene and safety practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiggy shows a badge for specific restaurants, who adhere to safety and health guidelines, but doesn’t go into much detail about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Extra thoughts ?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t dived deeply into the whole user journey, and picked up only major milestones in the user journey. There are plenty of things to look into and the following are suggestions for future features based on my personal bias/experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save for later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having no feature to bookmark restaurants despite repeated orders seems like a no-brainer. Zomato has this option, but to bookmark, the  “More info” option has to be clicked after clicking on the restaurant name and then it gets bookmarked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A food-enthusiast like me, used to screenshot the burgers which I wanted to try next from Truffles :3 (hopefully, there’s a better way)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My own ratings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing stopping me from ordering from a place which I previously rate as 1-star or 2-star. Why are my past ratings not visible to me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zomato doesn’t have this. One can access this on Swiggy if they look at their past orders, but there’s no preventive step here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How nuclear testing solved the obesity mystery ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Around 75 years ago, a patch of the New Mexican desert was incinerated during the first trial of the most destructive weapon ever created…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-nuclear-testing-solved-the-obesity-mystery/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-nuclear-testing-solved-the-obesity-mystery/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Around 75 years ago, a patch of the New Mexican desert was incinerated during the first trial of the most destructive weapon ever created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the US signed the UN Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1996, American physicists and engineers had conducted more than 1,000 tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They blew up nuclear weapons in the ocean, on land, in space even and underground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric nuclear tests have been internationally banned since the early 1960s because of worries about radioactive fallout and different risks. These weren’t baseless fears. In the 1950s, US physicists drastically miscalculated the explosive yield of a thermonuclear bomb during a test in the Pacific Ocean, and the ashy radioactive fallout was detected as far away as India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the experts and scientists of the time didn’t realize is that they had actually launched two experiments. Not only were they measuring the deadly power of these nuclear weapons, but they had also radioactively labelled the entire human race unknowingly. Some years later (and for a limited window), those bombs would reveal new insights about the human body - like how we become fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists working on these tests spent comparatively little time considering nuclear fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is nuclear fallout ?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radioactive fallout is radioactive material produced by a nuclear explosion or a nuclear reactor accident that enters the atmosphere and eventually falls to Earth. This fallout consists of minute, radioactive particles of dust, soil, and other debris. This isn’t like the ash generated from an ordinary fire. Because the high-energy nuclear explosion actually creates very minute particles. In fact, one particle of fallout dust is hundreds of times smaller than a single blood cell in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fallout particles are so small and light, they can drift in the atmosphere for years and settle anywhere in the world, which is exactly what happened. Radioactive carbon peaked in the mid 1960s, and was still dwindling in the air, slowly for decades after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, fallout settles. Plants absorb it, and then we eat the plants (or we eat other animals that ate the plants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Radioactive carbon in our bodies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon is an essential ingredient for life, and your body uses it to forge the walls of every cell it creates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your body creates a cell, it uses whatever carbon it has on hand, whether that’s radioactive C-14 or ordinary C-12. Of course, the vast majority of all the carbon in your body is C-12. However, that all changed in the 1950s with the increased levels of C-14 in air, due to the nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have already heard or read about carbon dating (a technique used to calculate the age of ancient artifacts and human remains)  and it’s essentially relevant here, because scientists use it to measure the ratio of C-14 to C-12. By examining the amount of C-14 in a human cell, it can tell whether the cell was created before the era of nuclear testing, during the mid-1960s spike, or sometime after. It’s as if the U.S. and Soviet governments had labelled every cell in every person’s with a ”date stamp”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All about those fat cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are made of billions of fat cells. Each one is a miniature fat-storing reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other cells, like those in the adult brain and nervous system, remain forever. Or so scientists thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, before the C-14 study, no one knew how long fat cells lived. Were you born with an allotment of fat cells that you kept for life? Or did they live, die, and multiply throughout your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, scientists went looking for C-14 in all the fat cells and tried to measure the amount of C-14 to figure out the average fat cell age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that our bodies manage fat with precision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, whether you’re fat or thin, gaining weight or losing it, your body works to keep a steady number of fat cells alive in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that fat cells don’t last forever. On average the fat cells in our bodies can live for 9-10 years, and they only shrink or grow in size as your diet, lifestyle etc. changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your fat cell count&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, there was a lingering question still unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your body works so hard to maintain a specific number of fat cells, what determines that number? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, researchers know that an obese adult body has more fat cells than a lean one. So what tells your body how many fat cells to create - or whether you should be thin or obese &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is not entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe that it may be linked to childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that your body does add fat cells while you’re young, and all the way through adolescence. Worryingly, children that are obese have more fat cells from an early age — and they’re at a far greater risk for adult obesity, thereby boosting the chances of a lifetime struggle with weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the complete answer is likely more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the effects of the Cold War surge of radioactive fallout are dwindling. Scientists estimate that by 2050 the effect may disappear altogether. The air will be cleaner and less radioactive, and we’ll lose a valuable window to the innermost workings of our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[App store wars - How it has transformed beyond the gaming industry ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[The global debate against app stores monopolistic practices and their control in distribution and managing of applications has been going…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/app-store-wars/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/app-store-wars/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global debate against app stores monopolistic practices and their control in distribution and managing of applications has been going for a some time now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brands started seeing the opportunity in apps a decade ago, further bolstered by the pandemic that created a huge boost in mobile commerce, which is not just to capture attention and brand loyalty but revenue as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although branded apps, just like games live within the walled garden of app stores. And to have a place in the app store, a company has to comply with the rules set by whoever owns the app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key issue pertains to the &lt;strong&gt;30% commission fee&lt;/strong&gt;, which several developers term as ”&lt;em&gt;extremely high&lt;/em&gt;” and ”&lt;em&gt;unfair&lt;/em&gt;”. Google and Apple currently dominate the mobile operating systems and their app stores have mostly become the default channel for developers to distribute their apps. This is a problem in a way, because people say that Google and Apple act like gatekeepers and they force developers to pay 30% commission from the revenue generated which can affect the developers’ bottom line. Even though there are strict rules for billing , there are certain apps on the app store who do not necessarily follow this like Netflix, Spotify, Tinder among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Apple and Google have overlooked this for long. So it raised quite a lot of eyebrows when Apple picked a fight against Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, for allegedly violating their app store policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the Epic Games lawsuit transformed into something huge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bypass this 30% fee, Epic decided to enable the option for players to pay directly to the game developer for in-app purchases, cutting Apple out of sales. And Apple naturally pulled Fortnite out the app store. Post which, Epic Games hit back Apple with a lawsuit, alleging that it has monopolized the iOS app distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:299px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What qualifies as in-app purchases?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-app purchases of digital goods like buying game tokens, virtual items or subscriptions bought from within the app will be counted as in-app transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s strange ?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has been strictly implementing this policy and charging the 30% fees, whereas Google has typically been lax about it, due to which companies like Netflix, Spotify, Tinder among others have bypassed this system to avoid paying the fee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Apple has overlooked that for quite some time now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no specific reason why it has done that.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if I take the example of Netflix, I know that the company doesn’t necessarily depend on the app store for people to use their service. In fact, people would prefer watching Tv shows and movies on bigger screens, so even if Apple or Google forces them to abide by this rule, it doesn’t affect Netflix much. But it does affect Epic Games, because currently you cannot download and play Fortnite outside the iOS or android ecosystem, they need to be listed on their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Netflix is a huge company, not as big as Apple but definitely bigger than Epic Games, so essentially they can fight this fight against Apple. From a legal perspective, if supposedly Apple puts a case against Netflix for this cause, Netflix can fight back with an anti-trust lawsuit against Apple claiming they’re pushing Apple Tv+ and suppressing other channels like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Games Vs Apple isn’t like David Vs Goliath. Sure, it’s fiscally insignificant compared to Apple: revenue of $4.2 billion in 2019 versus Apple’s $260.2 billion. But we’re still talking billions, and it will have an impact far beyond these two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It goes to say, this has definitely created an impact, and it’s not just limited to gamers or gaming companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All about the Google-Paytm fiasco&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if the timing for all of this was synchronized, concerns of app store monopoly recently emerged in India after Google briefly took down Paytm earlier this month for alleged violation of its app policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel to the fire, later on Google issued a clarification of its existing payment policy saying that everybody who is on the play store and sells digital content will have to use play-billing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy has been there for a long time, but again it just chose to make the announcement at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems strange because Google never explicitly went out and say that it’s pulling Paytm off the Play Store, it just issued a clarification on the Play store’s gambling policies and pulled the app out from play store and it only got this much attention, because Paytm created a ruckus out of it. Similarly, when Google issued the play-billing notice, the app makers, especially Indian startups went ballistic and called out Google for this unfair policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google replied back by saying they’re allowing app creators till September 2021 to comply with this and provided an extra 6 months to Indian start-ups (March 2022).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Paytm First games is back on the play store now, but only a free version of the app is allowed. Paytm accuses Google of double standards in this matter, as according to Play store’s regulations they cannot advertise the First games app on their Paytm app because it falls under fantasy gaming, but they can still do so on Youtube. This does make sense, because on one hand Google wants to take a stand against fantasy gaming but on the other hand it’s willing to advertise fantasy gaming on Youtube for some fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Paytm’s double standards ?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:300px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paytm has become the front line figure for Indian brands who are fighting this fight, riding on this wave of ”&lt;em&gt;Atmanirbhar&lt;/em&gt;” India. The timing couldn’t be better as they launched the mini app store, just days after Google removed paytm from the Play Store. This project was probably in work for some months now (probably to take on their rival PhonePe) but it chose this specific moment to advertise itself as an “Indian App Store”, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question arises, will an Indian App Store even be like ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will it be owned by the government ? If it’s owned by the government will there be certain restrictions on the data which the govt can access ? (There should be, ideally)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will it rather be owned by a single private body ? But if it is, the same issues that exist with Google today, will exist in this case too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mini app store of Paytm is a great example of this. Because firstly it is not an app store, it allows developers to showcase something in between websites and full-fledged apps that run inside the Paytm app, which means it’s limited by what the Paytm app can allow it to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the number of features developers have access to on this mini app is limited, it’s not like a full-fledged app which has  access to the data inside your phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, Paytm’s mini app store is just &lt;strong&gt;another walled garden&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no different from Google play store and Apple’s app store. To be listed on the Paytm mini app there are certain rules one has to abide by, for example, if one wants to sell something or want people to subscribe to any service, they will have to use Paytm for transactions, which is literally the same thing Google is asking people to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Paytm is saying that it is not going to charge any commission for using Paytm or UPI and only charge 2% for transactions made through debit and credit card, which is much lower than what Google charges, but again there’s nothing stopping Paytm from increasing these commissions in future, especially if in the future it’s able to have a billion users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, experts believe that this move definitely seems in sync with Paytm’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://openthemagazine.com/columns/indias-first-superapp-paytm/&quot;&gt;Super app strategy&lt;/a&gt;, so other than Paytm’s core sell i.e., the wallet, a bunch of other things can be done through the app. This idea is not so new though, Paytm’s rival, PhonePe has it’s own ”&lt;strong&gt;Switch&lt;/strong&gt;” platform which works exactly the same way and has existed since 2018 and has 220+ partners and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the consumer at the end of the day, it can be a Catch-22 situation, with ultimately no useful solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Food from the future - Lab grown meat]]></title><description><![CDATA[Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet.

The research also tells us that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And surprisingly it’s not just land animals but also the large impact of freshwater fish farming, which provides two-thirds of such fish in Asia, and was initially thought to be relatively environment friendly, actually isn’t. This is because of the deposition of excreta and unconsumed feed down to the bottom of the pond, where there is minimal oxygen, making it the perfect environment for methane (a greenhouse gas) production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food insecurity already impacts more than 2 billion people, while nearly 690 million people are hungry — an increase of 10 million from 2019, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates the COVID-19 pandemic could add up to 132 million people to this number, depending on the economic growth scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the entire supply chain of the meat industry contributes to an array of environmental issues affecting climate change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are ways to deal with this problem like -  Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options. Similarly, subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on food and dairy also seems fairly important to curb the demand for meat and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how about instead of reforming processes in the industry we shift our focus to something new entirely, an alternative source to the food that we eat ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lab-grown meat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is it ?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of growing meat in a laboratory involves taking stem cells from a live animal and growing them in nutrient-rich conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells are split into several cell types including muscle and fat cells. This biomass is then processed to form the edible final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it sounds complicated, cultured meat takes much less time to grow, uses fewer of the planet’s resources, and no animals are slaughtered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Origin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many inventions that happened during or due to World War 2, lab-grown meat is also one of them. The Dutch researcher and entrepreneur, Willem Frederik van Eelen aka the godfather of lab-grown meat, came up with the idea of growing meat in labs after he experienced two things while being a POW in Indonesia: terrible hunger, which he said nearly killed him, and the mistreatment of animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, he became determined to find a way to feed the world’s population without harming animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Innovation on the rise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still going to be a while until we see cultured meat, aka cell-based meat, on the menu, but start-ups have been working on it for five years. They’re progressing fast and the industry is big business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, Israeli start-up &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleph-farms.com/&quot;&gt;Aleph Farms&lt;/a&gt; claimed to be the first company to have developed steak in a lab. It hopes to trial the steak in high-end restaurants in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2021, with an official launch in restaurants and supermarkets in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shiokmeats.com/&quot;&gt;Shiok Meats&lt;/a&gt;, based in Singapore, was founded in 2018 by two stem cell scientists, and the company says its patent-pending technology can grow crustaceans four times faster than the conventional method. Just a few weeks ago, the company managed to recreate shrimp in its lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are some 55 countries across the world who are involved in developing some variety of cell cultured meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the challenges?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To scale up production of cultured meat and lessen costs, there are a few innovative difficulties confronting organizations — and these are something the worldwide life science and healthcare company Merck is attempting to overcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cell line development- Specific, food-grade meat producer cell lines are needed that are genetically stable; capable of differentiation and improved for large-scale production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bioreactors and bioprocessing - Bioreactors, bioprocess design and automation platforms are needed that enable growth and differentiation of multiple cell types simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edible scaffolds- Similar to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are needed to enable the next generation of structured products such as biodegradable, edible scaffolds/biomaterials and 3D cell culture processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the challenges are overcome, the cost of producing cultured meat will come down. According to reports, the costs have already reduced dramatically over the past few years, from estimates of hundreds of thousands of dollars per kilo to $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;People perception of lab-grown meat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the cost comes down and the process becomes scalable, there’s still a question of demand. Will people necessarily want to eat something they know has been grown in a lab, rather than a field? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cultured meat industry has a literal image problem, which seems unfamiliar and unappetizing. Images in popular media of cultured meat today look sterile, scientific, unappetizing; something to touch with a rubber glove or eat out of a petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the signs are promising, for now, it seems there are few technological and marketing hurdles to overcome before cultured meat will be feeding people, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When will it be on our plate?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies working on cultured meat — including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mosameat.com/&quot;&gt;Mosa Meat&lt;/a&gt; and US-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memphismeats.com/&quot;&gt;Memphis Meats&lt;/a&gt;, the two startups with the most funding — have a similar time in mind to launch their first product: 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an exception, though. The American company Just says their first product — cultured chicken — has been market ready since 2018, but they are waiting for the regulatory requirements of cultured meat to be more clearly established in the US before launching commercially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’ll actually see the impact of cultured meat, however, might take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have billions of animals that are being raised and are being eaten,” said Daan Luining from Meatable. “If you can just reduce that 10%, 20% it would be massive on the environment, but we don’t expect that to be done within 10 years. The only thing that is now on our horizon is just stopping the growth of animal consumption. If we can just do that it will be a huge win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will it be affordable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first products will likely be released at a small scale and with a premium price in select restaurants or retail vendors. Nonetheless, that may change a great deal depending on the type of meat and the technology used by each company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most organizations are attempting to deliver their own variants of beef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cattle are the least efficient links in production — pigs are twice as efficient, and chickens are four times more efficient,” said Peter Verstrate of Mosa Meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what now ?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get caught up in the latest food trend. We are being sold the message that in order to save the planet we need to buy alternative protein products, yet I truly think what we need to be doing is just buying less and using what we buy better, not buying what the big food companies tell us to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I’d spend the summer months with my grandparents in the countryside. For them, meat wasn’t an everyday thing. It was a treat on a Saturday or Sunday. I think we need to return to that. Animal products are a luxury product, regardless of whether they come from the lab or the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that I think that this isn’t a truly remarkable invention in the field of science, I personally cannot wait to taste a lab-grown hamburger. But maybe a simpler solution exists, maybe it’s just as easy as a behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How does a country become carbon neutral ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[A growing number of countries are setting targets to end their contribution to global warming, leading to devising national strategies…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/How-does-a-country-become-carbon-neutral/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/How-does-a-country-become-carbon-neutral/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/1543d57235492616f91bcd33d63b9901/30.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Limit temperature rise&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of countries are setting targets to end their contribution to global warming, leading to devising national strategies focusing on becoming carbon-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon neutrality has been a trending term for some time and while it’s not a new concept, the idea of an organization taking responsibility for its own carbon footprint is resonating strongly since the signing of the Paris Agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since consumers are increasingly becoming aware about climate change and are starting to look at the environmental impact of their consumption, we’re able to see more businesses and organizations focusing on this, leading to the term “carbon neutral” popping up in product descriptions and marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly is carbon neutrality ?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commscouncil.nz/downloads/Guidelines_for_carbon_claims_and_the_Fair_Trading_Act.pdf&quot;&gt;NZ Commerce Commission’s Guidelines For Carbon Claims&lt;/a&gt;, there is no universally accepted definition of carbon neutrality.
However, the basic premise is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure emissions, reduce them, and offset what’s remaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net calculated carbon emissions equal zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that net-zero refers to reaching zero through reduction and offsetting. It does not mean that no emissions were produced in the activity, because let’s be honest, that is impossible to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can carbon neutrality be achieved by mid-century?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climatecommuniques.com/Trillion-Tonne-Communique.aspx&quot;&gt;IPCC report&lt;/a&gt;(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) states that we need to limit carbon emissions to around one trillion tonnes. Around half of this has been emitted already. At current rates, we will be able to pass the one trillion cap in around 30 years. This means the transition to a virtually zero-emissions economy has to start now and be substantially in place by mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This timeframe seems very ambitious, to be quite honest but it is technically feasible. This will require an unprecedented level of political will and cooperation – but something that is unprecedented doesn’t mean that it is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to become carbon neutral?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/27c85716e4c78870f622a8b3cb0dc96c/31.gif&quot; alt=&quot;How to get to net zero&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to realise that it’s not only the fossil fuel-intensive sectors that are facing challenges in reducing their emissions. The land use sector is also increasingly under the spotlight. The nature of the food, agriculture and land use system means it is trickier to navigate political, ideological, social and environmental issues to put pressure on these sectors to reduce their emissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing need is to also focus on ramping up the ‘carbon absorption’ capabilities of forests, soil, oceans and other natural sinks means it is time to address this challenge. It is a simple scientific fact that if the global goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 is to be met, the role of natural carbon sinks (forests, oceans and soils, as well as other natural systems that ‘suck up’ carbon) will play an increasingly important role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways we can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting to 100% renewable energy&lt;/strong&gt;
Utilising energy efficiency at scale to reduce energy demand, and simultaneously decentralising and decarbonising power generation and transmission so renewables can make a stable contribution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using technologies that result in ‘negative emissions’. &lt;/strong&gt;
This concept has emerged recently that describes the possible use of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to produce negative carbon dioxide emissions by combining biomass use with geologic carbon capture and storage (CCS).
In layman terms, crops absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. When burned in a power station, the resulting carbon dioxide is captured and then buried in wells, mines or geologic formations underground or under the sea. Electricity generation using BECCS then becomes a net absorber of CO2 rather than a net emitter.
From what we understand, in theory, achieving carbon neutrality could be easier if this process could be scaled up cost-effectively. But in real life there are very few projects that show this to be the case.
The enormous amount of land and water needed to grow crops to burn could also worsen food and water security, especially for the world’s poor – adding to climate injustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focus on auto industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more significant attempts at carbon neutrality have been made in electricity and transportation which, combined, make up almost half of global emissions, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c2es.org/content/international-emissions/&quot;&gt;Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organisation forging practical solutions to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As transport is increasingly electrified through battery or hydrogen-powered vehicles, electricity generation will play an even bigger role in decarbonisation. Although the automotive industry still faces a fair bit of challenges particularly with EVs particularly pricing and developing a robust charging infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;China’s 2060 carbon neutral plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China became the newest addition to the list of 30 countries who have vowed to become carbon neutral (these countries account for about 43 per cent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that China has been the world’s biggest carbon emitter for a while, far greater than the US and European nations combined, there are many experts who believe this is going to significantly affect the world’s carbon emissions. China released the equivalent of 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the United States and three times as much as the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look at China specifically, who says that it has good reasons for its high numbers, calling out foreign nations for outsourcing their polluting industries to China, or to developing countries. China agrees to it for the sole purpose of earning money and leading better lives. And only after citizens protesting this - No air pollution, no carbon emissions, no plastic, did China take a stand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uplifting thing is China is also the biggest investor in green energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/01/11/china-renewable-energy-superpower/#bc218a0745a2&quot;&gt;China has taken a lead in renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; and is now the world’s largest producer, exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And experts say that the transition to renewable sources of energy wouldn’t be easy as they will need to be able to generate 2x or 3x times than current numbers, to reach that goal of carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal will be a challenge for China, which actually makes me wonder about how China may possibly go about this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does China plan to phase out coal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, China would need to stop burning coal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China heavily relies on coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels for its electricity production and it is a major ask for a country that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/&quot;&gt;home to half of the world’s coal power capacity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the target apply to all greenhouse gas emissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has pledged “carbon neutrality” rather than “climate neutrality” (What is climate neutrality ?), a less stringent target than that adopted by the EU and UK. It takes much longer to get to climate neutrality than carbon neutrality, usually around 10-20 years as non-CO2 emissions are hard to eliminate and need to be offset by removing carbon dioxide from the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this goal also be applicable to the “belt and road” investments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is also financing a quarter of coal plants under development in other countries through its ground-breaking “belt and road” initiative, with a capacity of 102 GW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stricter implementation at home country leads to outsourcing of pollution, it will undermine the climate benefits. On the other hand, if China encourages other countries to join the net zero club, it will further amplify them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Chinese cities and companies set net zero targets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is fairly optimistic to believe that a national-level policy could act as an important catalyst for companies and cities, encouraging them to declare their own net zero targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year many Chinese energy and industry companies launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://zero-carbon.org.cn/&quot;&gt;“Zero Carbon China” initiative&lt;/a&gt; which signalled confidence to the government to adopt the carbon neutrality target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If China manages to fulfill Xi’s goal, it could prevent 0.4 to 0.7 degrees (0.2 to 0.4 degrees Celsius) further warming for the world, according to “very rough estimates” by MIT management professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/china-s-jinping-top-global-emitter-aims-to-go-carbon-neutral-by-2060-120092300101_1.html&quot;&gt;John Sterman&lt;/a&gt;, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is ambitious but consistent with what climate scientists are saying: To peak global emissions by around 2020 and reduce them to net zero by around mid-century, to have a good chance of staying below the globally agreed limit of a 2 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any higher and the impacts are devastating, especially for the poor and most vulnerable who have contributed little to global warming and stand to lose the most.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What should India's Covid-19 strategy look like?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Before the end of March, India was in the strictest of lockdown anywhere in the world.

And India’s COVID-19 strategy was praised by experts across the world. Back then contact tracing was rigorous and testing precisely guided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later (time really flies, doesn’t it), India’s strategy to tackle COVID-19 is suspect. Looking at this through three aspects : understanding the infectivity of coronavirus, treatment of those testing positive without stressing the existing public health service and planning the strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the sudden restrictions on mobility led to panic and violations of lockdown, particularly by migrant workers, daily wagers and people stranded away from home, which rendered the lockdown pretty ineffective. Many of these people were housed in camps, often poorly run, by government agencies or cash-strapped, ill-equipped NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weeks COVID-19 testing was limited to authorised government laboratories, and available conditional on pre-determined criteria. The government took a cautious approach, most likely to protect scarce testing resources. In light of this fact, it definitely seemed that imposing strict lockdowns was the best way to slow down the virus, despite the economic repercussions. And it all would have made sense had the authorities utilised the time for preparing their testing infrastructure. After all, it’s about planning everything for the time that’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Having granular numbers is important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if we consider the information, we have right now, we would require access to data in a granular form to understand beyond the existing big numbers that have been provided by the government i.e., no of tests done, no. of cased identified, no of deaths, no of recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions including&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are all the tests that have been done ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all of the tests done, what is the breakdown of rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR tests?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the results of these tests?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why were these tests done in a particular place ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What was the profile of the person on whom this test was performed ? (To understand whether the person was a traveller, a healthcare worker, was asymptomatic or not etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some locations in the country do report these numbers, but all of this data is not collated at a single place, and one has to go through each state in order  to obtain this information. What it means is, when we talk about testing it becomes difficult to trust the numbers on face value. RT-PCR tests are considered the gold standard for testing, due to its accuracy. For antigen testing, the chances of a false negative is much higher. You understand where I am going with this ? More information is needed! In order to make sense of the testing data, and to use it for prediction, all of this information is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another number - the no. of recoveries happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does a &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt; recovery rate mean ? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am no expert, but even I understand  that if the mortality rate, as being told by the media, is 2% it implies that the recovery rate is 98%. So does the number of recoveries in a day mean anything and what is the criteria for calculating it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does recovery mean? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my understanding, it means when a person contracted the virus and then got better after a certain number of days. (maybe 14, but I am unsure)
So again, what’s the official criteria here for calculating these numbers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it mean the patient has tested negative ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it mean that the patient was released from hospital or quarantine ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were the patient’s symptoms gone when they were let go  ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no clarity on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And also on how states decide on making that distinction, because there is a difference in choosing how to report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is facing criticism for it’s reporting methodologies and its relatively low death rate has come under question especially since India doesn’t have a robust database on the cause of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving on from the data, let’s talk about the treatment that people are receiving. We know now, the risk the virus possesses for people with comorbid conditions, people who can get really sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we know the proportion of the population who get very sick, with any degree of accuracy, it becomes easier to predict the demand on healthcare services. To ensure there’s a consistent supply of healthcare services to serve these people who are severely affected, while ensuring it’s not stressing out the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we’re talking about patients suffering from comorbid conditions, there’s a key factor to look into here that normally doesn’t get attention - preventive service in public health. A large chunk of people who suffer from heart ailments, diabetes etc. can get tested earlier to reduce the risk of the disease, but it simply doesn’t happen. Partly because insurance services do not cover such treatments or tests. Preventive care is not incentivised so no one cares about it, it’s only when procedures are being done, that can help the hospitals earn money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with data is there are many methods of collecting data. Some of them are collected through labs, some are distinct, but very few are joint up together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a coordinated data system is a pre-requisite for handling diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be an organization that is an integrated program that handles all the data from the country and then integrates it all together at one place. This information will also be useful if/when India comes up with a vaccine. Whenever that happens, a vaccine strategy would be required to decide where vaccine programs can be set up and how much supply will be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is still developing its vaccine distribution strategy. While it stands united in saying that the frontline health workers directly interacting with COVID-19 patients will be the first recipients of the vaccine, there seems to be no clarity on who will come next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Saving the economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the debate, between economy and healthcare, we know that it is in the best interest of public health to keep our economic health strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting the infamous phrase from Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s the economy, stupid!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the disease started spreading, it is becoming more apparent that the virus is extremely transmissive and we cannot control it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the general belief  that when any nation enters the community transmission phase, there’s no point in trying to contain the disease. Despite having such high numbers, the government has never acknowledged that there is community transmission in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following what developed nations did, and enforcing a complete lockdown was simply impossible to do in India. People had to go to work, because a majority of the population relied on daily wages. Thousands of migrants had travelled back to their villages, at a time when the government was asking people not to get out of their homes. The decision to reverse it should have happened much earlier. And due to this negligence, many people lost their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There shouldn’t have been a delay in relaxing restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would have been casualties, just like it is right now. But the industries would have been going on, and the economy would have been in a slightly better position. And the real tragedy of this whole ordeal is that the downward trend we’re seeing in the economy is not something that will affect people who are well-settled, people like you and me, but it will affect a large chunk of people who are used to poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of preparing for restrictions, we should have been focused on preparing for adequate healthcare for those who were going to be severely affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s response to detecting the COVID-19 outbreak was reactive, not proactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world imported the lockdown strategy from China much like the coronavirus itself. But while China backed its lockdown strategy with door-to-door service delivery - aided well by a population trained to obey its government - the rest of the world including India failed to meet the basic needs of the most vulnerable and the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UPDATE :&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has previously had universal immunization drives focusing specifically on children and women which accounts for around 4 crore of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be the first time when such a huge number of people will be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government expects 400-500 vaccine doses that it hopes to cover 20-25 crore people, which also depends on how the vaccine results come up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan the government is working on right now is to augment  every step in the process involved in the universal immunization template - focusing essentially on  manufacturing and administration. One of the key points here is to create a backend infrastructure to store the vaccine. Also, training manpower across the steps in vaccine creation to delivery will have to be planned and executed beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Train manpower - Training has begun at state level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Training for a cold chain facility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Training for injecting vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Training for last mile deliver&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tracking the vaccines from the manufacturer, to transportation, to final delivery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has pointed out that to execute the vaccination drive, it will be done along the lines of how elections are conducted in India and rope in schools also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we know now that a person has to be given 2-3 doses of the vaccine, basically meaning that you will need a certificate after every dose. For this purpose they’re developing a QR code which will generate an e-certificate that can be stored in DigiLocker, which can be accessed by you anytime or accessed by govt. after consent is given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the challenges ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysing state requirements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;States have been asked to submit a list of priority groups particularly front line workers (at district, village, gram level), to analyse and facilitate the vaccination program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cold storage facilities have to be ramped up to ensure the vaccines can reach these locations on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how many doses will be available to each state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roping in private hospitals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private hospitals are saying that they have their own vaccine delivery mechanisms in place. This is something that is still being looked into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the government allow private citizens to go to hospitals, pay money and get themselves vaccinated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe it will, but there will definitely be certain conditions to prevent exploitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transportation of vaccine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How good is India’s cold chain facility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a vaccine is not kept in the required temperatures, then it will not work and all that effort will be wasted. It will not help you build any antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence that’s what happens if you don’t have a robust cold chain facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s cold chain is known to be one of the most robust in the world. The capacity that we have is some 27,000 cold chain points in the country, although it isn’t enough, which can store 300 million doses. The government is aiming to store 400-500 million doses, which will require a scale up of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will involve converting existing cold chain storage for other items like food and beverages to storing drugs and vaccines, but it’s not so easy, because a certain, precise temperature needs to be maintained which needs to be tracked and monitored regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How much energy does the internet consume ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[So funnily enough, I am currently typing this on my laptop which consumes around 0.6kWh of power which also includes the Wifi router…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-much-energy-does-the-internet-consume/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-much-energy-does-the-internet-consume/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So funnily enough, I am currently typing this on my laptop which consumes around 0.6kWh of power which also includes the Wifi router connection, in a day. That connection runs through an access point, which is powered by a switch that connects to the fiber optic cable used by the ISP. After which, there’s a complex labyrinth of routers and servers (which is beyond my capabilities to explain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything involved in this process draws power, and particularly the computer power is spent in service of using the web - as I’m using Google Docs at the moment. Does that mean I should include all of that while computing for the energy the web consumes ? I say, yes, because without it, I wouldn’t be using the internet at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should make it abundantly clearly that the fundamental calculation to arrive at a number is …tricky, to say the least. Not that it has stopped people from actually finding that number, but it does involve some difficulties and a clear set of assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Factoring in all the energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the actual energy consumed, it should be made known that the internet is a hungry system. It’s a network of networks and each network consists of computers. And all these computers consume a huge amount of power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To actually estimate the amount of energy consumed, we need to consider every component that connects to the system. Furthermore, we need to think not only about what it takes to keep internet devices powered on but also what it takes to keep them in operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, let’s look at &lt;strong&gt;data centers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet relies on massive data centers that contain thousands of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entry of cloud services has been a boon for many of the businesses today, to cater their data center needs, which means that they hire some other company to provide the physical devices upon which the business’s data and services reside.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud service companies will store a customer’s data on multiple machines, for the purpose of redundancy. If a computer fails for some reason, the customer’s data remains intact because it exists on another machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downside of this arrangement is that each computer requires power to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers also generate heat, which can be bad news. If electronic components get too hot, they can malfunction. To keep the machines operating at a safe temperature, data center owners must invest in cooling systems like -  &lt;strong&gt;air conditioning&lt;/strong&gt;. We should also factor in the energy costs of air conditioning data centers in our final estimate since they are necessary to keep the Internet running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, getting an exact count of data centers is impossible - many companies keep the information about their data centers private as it can be a competitive advantage for them. It’s also impossible to say for certain how much power each data center requires without knowing all the details. And, again this hasn’t stopped people from trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Underwater cables are the invisible force driving the modern internet, with many in recent years being &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.telegeography.com/rising-tide-content-providers-investment-in-submarine-cables-continues&quot;&gt;funded&lt;/a&gt; by internet giants such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Considering existing studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wireless.kth.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/08/Emerging-Trends-in-Electricity-Consumption-for-Consumer-ICT.pdf&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, inferred that the internet was accounting for about 10% of the world’s energy use, up from 8% two years prior. However, this study was first published in 2014 — and given the pace of technological advancement, it’s hard to estimate how things have changed in 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or we could look at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320225452_Total_Consumer_Power_Consumption_Forecast&quot;&gt;since-updated 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; from Huawei researcher Anders Andrae, in which he determined that the ICT industry accounted for 3-5% of the world’s power expenditure in 2015, but could rise to as much as 20% by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is this disparity in numbers? 8% in 2012, 10% in 2014, 3-5% in 2015?
This clearly shows that here’s no clear methodology for answering this titular question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer it, we’d need to agree upon the factors, what matters and what doesn’t, and in what specific ways the measurements should be made — except infrastructure is updated so quickly that what you were measuring would change before you were finished measuring it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jtma/papers/emergy-hotnets2011.pdf&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2011, Barath Raghavan and Justin Ma of ICSI and University of California, Berkeley did the same study to find internet energy consumption was 2 percent then. They also pointed out that in their report the internet’s energy consumption is a fraction of that of the transportation industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two researchers suggest that because the Internet uses less power and causes a smaller environmental impact than transportation, moving more tasks to the Internet makes sense. Using teleconferencing rather than travel for meetings could save quite a bit of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about the future?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real picture that emerges when you look at how much energy the Internet uses is that it’s a complex issue. Without the Internet, we would have to rely on other methods to communicate and access data. Those methods might in turn require more energy and cause more pollution than the Internet does. If that’s the case, decreasing our reliance on these activities and focusing more on the Internet makes sense from an energy perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more emails we send, television and music we stream, and google docs we edit - the more devices, servers are needed to satisfy this growing and seemingly limitless hunger for data. (thanks Jio?) The internet improves the energy efficiency of a lot of non-digital industries. But we are connecting so many people and objects now that there are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320225452_Total_Consumer_Power_Consumption_Forecast&quot;&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; saying that global communication technologies’ impact on carbon emissions will grow immensely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that many major Internet companies are becoming more energy conscious, and choosing more renewable sources of power for data centers and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace’s report, Click Clean, assesses the energy policies of major Internet companies – including how many of their data centers are powered by renewable energy. In 2017, Apple, Google and Facebook earned the highest grades, while Chinese giants Tencent and Baidu ranked lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to prioritize sustainability, as the internet expands into new territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency mining is a high energy intensive process and has taken on industrial proportions in countries with cheap electricity and political favour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware production requires a lot of energy (so many phones and devices) even if it is easier not to think of the landfills filled with e-waste whenever we buy a new gadget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Towards the Internet of Energy (IoE)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to everything we’ve seen thus far, trying to get into specifics with the main question here is a fool’s errand. Regardless, one thing that can be determined is this: the internet draws a lot of power, and one thing’s for sure that number is just going to increase. (Given the covid-19 pandemic is pushing for remote activities, which may cause a behavioral shift)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, finding ways to run it more economically is important for various reasons, which is when we must look at the Internet of Things (IoT), which from the outside does seem like it’s adding to the energy drain, but it isn’t all bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applied to energy production infrastructure, it gives rise to the Internet of Energy (IoE) — a system for optimising the generation, storage and distribution of energy. Through using widespread sensors and machine learning, we can massively reduce energy waste, and ensure that the ever-increasing power demand of the internet is put to the most efficient use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just think about how much power is wasted by systems who continue to operate in a state of readiness when they’re not required to. Smart low-powered background systems could enable and disable power supply as needed, significantly reducing demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next item to look into is energy flow: when electricity is distributed throughout a grid, conductivity issues along the way often lead to energy loss. There are numerous systems in testing and development, such as ultra-high voltage transmission (UHV), which can transmit electricity significantly more rapidly and effectively than comparable systems, and it’s being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/article/20972092/worlds-biggest-ultrahigh-voltage-line-powers-up-across-china&quot;&gt;rolled out in China&lt;/a&gt; to serve power to isolated regions. Couple some similar updates to physical infrastructure with some AI-driven efficiency improvements, and we could see some major progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer magnitude of the internet poses some major problems when it comes to energy consumption — and while we can’t usefully tell exactly how much it consumes, we do have some idea of how big the problem will get if we don’t take any action to address it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coronavirus - Who would get the vaccine first ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[" 13% of developed wealthy nations have already claimed of over 50% from possible vaccine candidates, for their citizens " - Oxfam Since the…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/who-would-get-the-vaccine-first/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/who-would-get-the-vaccine-first/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;”&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/news/world/rich-nations-representing-13-of-population-bought-off-52-of-covid-vaccines-report-11600417915134.html&quot;&gt;13% of developed wealthy nations have already claimed of over 50% from possible vaccine candidates, for their citizens&lt;/a&gt;” - Oxfam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the pandemic, poorer nations have been worried about their chances to obtain vaccines at the time of need. This has led to many countries like India, Thailand to develop their own vaccines. The current count of vaccine developers in the world is roughly 170 but according to Airfinity, the count is around 280 - including about 50 in lower-income nationals such as Turkey, Egypt, Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also the feeling of “not wanting to be left out”. One doesn’t want to depend on the largess of other countries to protect their own people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Concern for “Vaccine Nationalism”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if every single vaccine currently in Phase 3 trials is successful, we will still not have enough vaccines for about half of the world’s population that consists of poor countries. Which begs for a massive uptake in production all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor countries will be left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated one billion vaccine doses have to be manufactured just to vaccinate workers in health care and other essential industries globally, assuming that only a single dose is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ones who actually turn out to be successful in a timely manner will be in great demand, especially from countries that have entered into advance agreements to enable increased supplies for more money. This would further drive up the prices of the vaccine, making it potentially unaffordable for a large number of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if the past is to take into account, the memories of 2009 swine flu outbreak still breeds fear, when vaccines barely made their way past the top tier of wealthy countries. Many countries in Africa had no access to these vaccines for months. Later on, US and some European countries finally agreed to release 10% of their stocks for other countries, but only after it had become evident that they didn’t need vaccines for them any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when anti-retrovirals were found to treat HIV, rich countries were able to supply it to its people whereas in poor countries, people continued dying without it, because prices weren’t affordable. And, in Africa, which was the worst affected region, these drugs were unavailable for several years after being developed in the 1990s. Even when they were first introduced in 2006, the early versions weren’t as effective there as in high-income nations, although subsequent shots have yielded positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do countries hoard vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus vaccine is being used by governments across the world as an opportunity to make an impression on their own people, as well as the international community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their citizens, the governments want to show how concerned they are about their safety and health, for which they would likely want to hoard as many vaccines as they potentially can.
They also want to flaunt their scientific capability and expertise, in front of their international neighbours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the reason why China and Russia have gone ahead in approving vaccines that have not yet completed necessary trials to prove they are safe and effective. And why Donald Trump is promising vaccine distribution in early November, just when the voting session begins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are political dividends for declaring oneself the first one to develop a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Call for equitable vaccine distribution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task of producing vaccines for the 7.1 billion population, has motivated countries to prepare for large-scale production, as well as pitted them against one another amid fears of a potentially limited vaccine supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brazil, China, and India all have large vaccine industries, they also have the largest populations in the world, and they could reserve their vaccine supplies for their own citizens before opening them up to others. Some other countries are seeking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/04/24/funding-the-development-and-manufacturing-of-covid-19-vaccines-the-need-for-global-collective-action/?utm_campaign=brookings-comm&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=87098309&quot;&gt;strike monopoly agreements&lt;/a&gt; with vaccine manufacturers to avoid domestic shortages. Brazil, US, and the European Union have all struck deals with AstraZeneca for hundreds of millions of doses of the University of Oxford vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts including CFR’s Bollyky have warned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765944?resultClick=1&quot;&gt;bidding wars&lt;/a&gt; over a vaccine will lead to inequitable distribution and, ultimately, fail to eliminate the risk of new outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard truth is that there is limited capacity to produce a vaccine. The wait for a vaccine for these countries could get prolonged because whatever doses are produced in the first few months or years would have to be sent to the richer countries to fulfil the contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, if some parts of the world continue to reel under the epidemic, due to lack of access to the vaccine, it would result in keeping the virus in circulation for a much longer time than necessary. That would mean that other countries too would remain at risk, at least economically if not health-wise, as it would lead to continued disruptions in global supply chains due to movement, work and trade restrictions in large parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Covid-19 anywhere is Covid-19 everywhere.” - Robert Silverman of Oxfam America said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are investing billions and are fast-tracking the process of vaccine development and of course they would want to make the most of this opportunity and rightfully, deserve to be compensated. But that doesn’t mean it has to come as the cost of lives of people who cannot afford or even access the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current need is for a solution that advocates the following -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;More transparency in biotech companies and their systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharing technology with the world and limiting patent protection, to ramp up production, when the need arises. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public health agencies play critical roles in vaccine research, supplying funds to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. A reminder here, is that a huge chunk of public money was also invested in building these vaccines. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealthier countries under-writing making doses available to countries who are less likely to afford them. Not everyone will be able to access it, but the priority here is to ensure that front line workers, elderly people etc. have access to it.  An ideal situation would involve ensuring that the vaccines are first made available to whoever needs them the most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global Vaccine Plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the WHO, CEPI, and Gavi launched COVAX, a global initiative seeking more than $18 billion in funding to procure two billion doses of a vaccine by the end of 2021.
172 economies are now discussing the possibility of participating in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, COVAX has the world’s largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio - including nine candidate vaccines, with a further nine under evaluation and conversations underway with other major producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of COVAX is by the end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification. They aim to provide these vaccines to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, with the priority on healthcare workers and then expand to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing, comorbid conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While, this is certainly a step in the right direction. But it’s actual effectiveness remains a question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVAX doesn’t prevent countries from signing their own independent deals with manufacturers, which can possibly put a strain on the already limited supply. Countries realise that the division of vaccines will leave them with only a small fraction, thus their need to seek independent deals with manufacturers still remains. Moreover, the count of 2 billion doses is a small number, when we consider the fact that the vaccines currently in Phase 3 trials require 2-3 doses to confer immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By itself, COVAX isn’t enough. The need is for a global commitment and better framework for how governments will upscale manufacturing and distribution in a safe and effective way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to tackle the rising E-commerce packaging waste]]></title><description><![CDATA[Due to physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, E-Commerce orders have skyrocketed and so has the packaging waste that…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-to-tackle-the-rising-e-commerce-packaging-waste/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-to-tackle-the-rising-e-commerce-packaging-waste/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, E-Commerce orders have skyrocketed and so has the packaging waste that comes with it. My orders at Amazon have become 4x more than what they were before. (Also, because of the Prime account). Anyhow, even though I love how easy they make it to get pretty much everything I need, I can’t help but feel a little guilty while opening up deliveries. There’s just so much packaging waste. After Prime day, my garbage bin was full and overflowing with Amazon’s packaging waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has huge environmental costs and there are no estimates about the amount of packaging and waste. Let’s try to unpack the problem. (PUN intended :P) firstly, and then discuss the new wave of packaging solutions that are popping up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PACKAGING WASTE FROM E-COMMERCE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all are drowning in a sea of packaging waste, and too much of it is ending up in landfills, or even worse, oceans. With no significant rules around this particular problem, over-packaging is a sought-out solution for many companies, to cater to the growth of priority customer services, that place a premium on ultra-fast delivery which effectively do not allow for consolidated delivery of goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers/Sellers are keen on ensuring that their goods arrive in pristine condition, to minimize costs, keeping “customer delight” at the core of it. And to protect those products, online retailers resort to piling on packaging - Bubble wrap, Styrofoam, Air packets, Massive cardboard boxes. Highly effective, but highly wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This affects not just by creating gregarious amounts of waste but also has the potential to lead to considerable loss of forest cover, since wood pulp is the primary raw material for producing packaging cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the status quo of packaging has devastating consequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING STRATEGIES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainablepackaging.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Definition-of-Sustainable-Packaging.pdf&quot;&gt;Sustainable Packaging Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, to be sustainable one has to follow the 8 criteria for packaging mentioned below :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is beneficial, safe &amp;amp; healthy for individuals and communities throughout its lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meets market criteria for performance and cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is sourced, manufactured, transported, and recycled using renewable energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizes the use of renewable or recycled source materials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is manufactured using clean production technologies and best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is made from materials healthy throughout the life cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is physically designed to optimize materials and energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is effectively recovered and utilized in biological and/or industrial closed-loop cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Sustainable packaging strategies&quot; title=&quot;Sustainable packaging strategies&quot; src=&quot;/static/84239ff06fe67c2b2f880e3213e0c90e/fcda8/s71.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;/static/84239ff06fe67c2b2f880e3213e0c90e/12f09/s71.png 148w,/static/84239ff06fe67c2b2f880e3213e0c90e/e4a3f/s71.png 295w,/static/84239ff06fe67c2b2f880e3213e0c90e/fcda8/s71.png 590w,/static/84239ff06fe67c2b2f880e3213e0c90e/5a190/s71.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COMPANIES SHIFTING TO SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that utilize e-commerce should look towards more sustainable packaging that has the strength to protect their products effectively and mitigate losses but also ensure recyclability to curb the negative environmental effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be done by factoring in three different aspects of sustainability - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the amount of packaging material used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase in recyclability of packaging materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of recycled packaging materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These companies should also explore the possibility of implementing buy-back policies, or even provide customers with the choice to opt for more sustainable methods of packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consolidated Storage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing packaging materials and minimizing waste are two big components of sustainable packaging. And when implemented correctly, they lead to more efficient storage, so you can limit the space required to house your products (thus lowering storage costs), or open up additional space to store more merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower logistic costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty intuitive.
Shifting from a box to a bubble mailer can knock anywhere from four to six ounces off the total weight of the package and reduce weight-based costs significantly while shipping. Multiplying this saving across millions of packages a year and the overall reduction in costs can be dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expand customer base and increase loyalty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrading packaging not only decreases a business’ carbon footprint but also can help a brand stand out to customers
A research by Nielsen found that 48% of consumers are willing to change their consumption habits to lower their impact on the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start-ups are popping up in the field of responsible packaging. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packmile.com/&quot;&gt;Packmile.com&lt;/a&gt; is a leading sustainable packaging company in India, with clients including Amazon, Bosch and Decathlon and has a portfolio of innovative products like Paper Bubble Wrap and Corrugated Box Recycling Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Large and Small Scale Businesses can Use Eco-Friendly Packaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Large-Scale Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a large company like Amazon, or Alibaba, there are two primary problems in adopting sustainable packaging. Firstly, these sites have a huge supplier base (maybe in thousands), that are scattered around the country (Or the world), all of whom have to comply with the same regulations. Making a wholesale packaging switch might be a slow and painful process.
Second, as these sites offer millions of products, the next go-to option is to find a producer who can create packaging that’s flexible for every item, and most importantly, has the ability to do so at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Small-Scale Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small e-commerce business might look like anything from an individual’s craft store - selling just a few items a month - to an independent bookstore that sells a few hundred products a month.
However, for the most part, these  businesses will deal with a much less varied set of products, comparatively, meaning it’s possible for them to depend on a single packaging system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on AMAZON&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon does have its fair share of eco-friendly initiative in this area, but many of them haven’t been implemented in India. (but let’s keep fingers crossed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Amazon India’s website, they say “ PFS is a sustainable packaging solution in which customer orders are shipped in their original packaging without any additional packaging or significantly reduced packaging.” They had first launched the program in India in June 2019 in nine cities and have now moved to 100 cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sustainable packaging initiatives like ‘frustration-free packaging and ship-in-own container,’ have also been able to reduce packaging waste by 25 percent since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am unsure how that works though, because when I searched for ‘ Frustration free packaging’, the results were spread across only 19 pages, and the numbers do not make sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway,..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon also has other initiatives that aren’t active in India currently, like providing customers to group their orders together or to opt for no-rush shipping, which empowers the customer to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEXT ?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carefully drafted law and genuine cooperation among all stakeholders, including e-commerce companies, consumers and local municipalities will be the key to ensure that the law is successfully implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, for effective transformation of e-commerce into Green commerce, companies need to invest in packaging innovation and sustainable supply chain mechanisms to promote reuse and recycling, while consumers also need to display sustainable consumption behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why brands need a better content marketing strategy during Covid-19 pandemic]]></title><description><![CDATA[Content is King.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content is King. (Damn right, it is!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it will play an important part, for brands to help uplift themselves and survive during these tough times. The world is now forever divided into pre COVID-19 and post COVID-19 narratives. Content marketing is how companies can set themselves up for the long term – pandemic or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies have reduced their marketing/content creation spend with their operations being hit, which seems like a logical move, because it essentially means putting your focus into more cost-driven activities, while having less than ideal revenue generating numbers. But going into hibernation is the wrong move here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things will go back to normal – or some new type of normal. When this happens, brands should have some momentum built up, something that can help them grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our daily routines have changed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While each one of us might have a different kind of day routine basis our jobs and responsibility division at home, but somethings are glaringly common amongst all of us :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumption of digital media has increased &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Washing dishes has become an everyday task&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooking/Baking activities have increased, for a plethora of reasons. And people are either entering their kitchens for the first time or on their way to become a chef. You know how I know that ? Instagram stories (So, again this circles back to point number one). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Instagram stories gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital experiences have abruptly replaced in-person experiences. Our content consumption has increased multi-fold and is greater than ever right now. According to recent data, the total minutes on the internet increased to 1466 minutes during April 2020 (a 11% increase from March 2020), as COVID-19 kept people indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand is massive, and with more time at hand, content creators are creating way more content than they ever did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What companies are doing right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the lockdown happened, many brands have taken inspiration from how mankind overcame setbacks such as The Great Depression, oil crisis in 1973 or even the 2007-08 economic recession to reassure consumers that the humankind has the strength and intelligence to emerge at the top of any challenge they face, including COVID-19, while keeping a positive tone as the underlying feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding new ways to reach your customers during an economic crisis is not new. Being all “the glass is half full”, this is the time for companies to break out their thinking hats and turn on innovation. Let’s take a step back, to the Great Depression. While many companies were re-evaluating their finances and cutting down on expenses, P&amp;amp;G’s marketing team took a different approach. As many people were staying in homes, the company started sponsoring radio broadcasts - which were relatively new at the time – with a key message, to promote the basic necessity - soap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was all said and done, P&amp;amp;G came out of the Great Depression in a much better shape than before! (FUN FACT: This also led to the origin of the term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/10/04/our-history-p-g-put-soap-soap-opera/732149001/&quot;&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, the biggest shift in content marketing is going to see a new emphasis on digital experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent efforts, consistent communication, frequent reminders - are some crucial ways for companies to engage and connect with customers. Right now, the winning ticket is to create content that is relevant to your business and informative, in a way that helps your potential customer or is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the B2B area , &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/&quot;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; , started giving away all their courses (except a certification one) at Moz Academy for free. That is some $1500+ worth of courses! And while they are obviously missing out on good revenue in the short term, the long-term impact is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content marketing and SEO, work so well together, they both go hand-in-hand. This was a brilliant move by the company to attract marketers across the industry, become familiar with the tools/program, learn skills and build a monumental amount of trust, so that when all of this is done marketer’s will know where to turn to when they are looking for SEO software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the B2C area, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cure.fit/cult/livesgt&quot;&gt;Cult.fit&lt;/a&gt; , a health and fitness company, launched their LIVE workout classes for free (Update: Launched paid subscription classes during late-may), just days before the lockdown was announced in India. In these workout classes, people could compete with fellow attendees or with their friends, which made for one engaging digital experience. They are also posting regular and engaging content to educate users on their app. The company is putting a considerable amount of resources into helping people stay active, healthy and positive - together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marketing in a post-covid world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to jump forward to the future, but we are at a stage to make some logical hypotheses for what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional advertising is going to become all but &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;. Priority of health &amp;amp; wellness and fear of unemployment lurking around has changed consumer’s behaviour. The concept of advertising via physical objects like direct mailers, paper newspapers etc. Can and will become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, more people are consuming content on their devices, especially while streaming Netflix or via social media channels. It’s likely for traditional TV advertising to be replaced by a more digital, robust model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User-generated content will see a rise, as the need for people to create connections will increase. A great way for brands to make more engaging content, is to give their customers or their employees, the spotlight, a place where they can be vulnerable and share their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x27;./2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;People connected&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There will be a lot of reluctance to get out of homes needlessly. Consumers will have questions about their favourite businesses, restaurants, go-to spots and about new businesses that have sprung up. And most of them will rely on trusty, old Google, to get these answers before actually venturing out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why content marketing works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour and how consumers look at brands. Brands with a purpose and meaning will resonate more with consumers, and in a more effective manner. It’s important for brands to communicate who they are and not just what they sell. Content marketing and thought leadership can help in creating that connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the period of uncertainty is here and will likely stay for some more time, consumers won’t have time for generalities and good to know material. They will look for information which could help them in navigating their situation better, and decide better Meaningful content should be build around the question “What’s in it for me”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/d03cbe9dede53018e5dcc88f67be4c1a/4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Connect to consumers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social listening and community engagement will be at the forefront while developing a marketing strategy. For example, companies were already hosting quizzes and sharing polls on twitter for a long time, but they have moved on to create mini-events like movie watch-along nights and leveraged the use of other channels like Instagram to increase their reach. Remember, how quick brands went on to create delightful and funny &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adgully.com/momentmarketing-how-brands-are-reacting-to-pubg-ban-in-india-96139.html&quot;&gt;illustrative content&lt;/a&gt; after Indian banned PUBG. More of that, please!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, content marketing is meant for success because it meets people where they are. Sure, we’ll likely reach a point where people will go out and about managing their day-to-day activities, but it may be a good long while before we flock back to movie theatres and restaurants. And how will people occupy their time? By consuming content on their devices, more specifically smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knows what uncertainties may arise in the following months. We simply cannot say what will happen in the economy, in coronavirus, in marketing. Although one thing is for sure, content marketing seems like a pretty safe bet to put your money on. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why you should rather be using a menstrual cup ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[FYI - This post is a tad bit different from my previous posts and is proportionately biased by my personal experiences, and many TMI alerts…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/why-you-should-rather-be-using-a-menstrual-cup/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/why-you-should-rather-be-using-a-menstrual-cup/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FYI - This post is a tad bit different from my previous posts and is proportionately biased by my personal experiences, and many TMI alerts, because I will get into graphic details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been waiting to write about this since the beginning of this year, and my time has come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/3e9e54032ab1d69553db6e0b37b95d90/1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Old turtle saying his time has come&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having only used plain ol’ sanitary napkins, my next go-to move was to try tampons. Of course, this decision only materialized a year ago, when I was on a trip that involved getting wet/being in water and I didn’t want something this trivial to “wash” over all my plans. Out of the need for better leakage-control, and after being vetted by many,many of my girlfriends, I took the plunge and got some tampons. My worries of leakage, stains, rashes, disposal subsided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A girl was happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to January 2020, and I decided to self-check and analyse my life’s activities with sustainability and zero waste at the crux of it. Now of course, I was going to look into menstrual waste generated through single-use pads and tampons and find ways to reduce my output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I heard about Menstrual Cups for the first time, probably some 3-4 years ago, and the very fact of putting some alien object inside me, made me shudder. More so, the fact that one had to reuse the same cup multiple times, seemed extremely unhygienic to me. (It’s really not)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why use a menstrual cup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping aside the fact that a person uses (more specifically, myself) 10 sanitary pads in a month, which becomes 120 pads in a year, which can potentially lead to using 4560 pads in their lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/69442cb956c9ee33a7c097f0864932dc/2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Girl saying that&amp;#x27;s a lot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I decided to find a solution. A quick 2 hour web search told me all about the various sanitary products, and after some discussions on online forums like Reddit, which also involved a detailed comparison of biodegradable pads Vs Menstrual cups, I made my decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI, Biodegradable pads are great, well almost, because they need to be segregated and personally composted in a separating compost pit, so that they can actually go back to earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How menstrual waste is treated currently&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you guessed, landfills, you’re absolutely correct!
Only two cities in India — Bengaluru and Pune — implement solid waste interventions to effectively segregate and identify menstrual waste during routine garbage collection.
Anyway, it still goes through some small scale incineration or burying for disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My experience with it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read many articles/reviews and watched thousands of YouTube videos that reviewed the product, gave tips on insertion/removal, hygiene tips etc. before actually committing to the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/33d516926be02938f4bbac4f3fcae13f/3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cat reading book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought this - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Approved-Reusable-Menstrual-Silicone/dp/B07548J9WC/ref=pd_lpo_121_t_0/259-8192318-0440851?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B07548J9WC&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=d68b39f7-8abc-4229-8bf4-aa368625d22d&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=fo244&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=egqhS&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=5a903e39-3cff-40f0-9a69-33552e242181&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=KYTABYFRHBEJC7Z5V39E&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=KYTABYFRHBEJC7Z5V39E&amp;amp;smid=AT95IG9ONZD7S&quot;&gt;Sirona Reusable Menstrual Cup for Women - Medium Size&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon, because it had more reviews and a good amount of 4-star reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 1 : Unboxing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the box I received was not in a great state, which may be due to the fact that it spent 5 days outside, to quarantine it. But the actual cup was vacuum sealed in plastic, so it was all okay inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 2 : Sanitization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has to sanitize the cup before using it for the first time, by boiling it in plain water for 10 minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cup needs to be folded before inserting it, and there are various techniques for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I personally like the punchdown folding method)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 3 : Insertion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#TMI&lt;/strong&gt;
I remember that dance I did in the bathroom when I tried to use a tampon for the first time. I thought it would be something like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took some 20-30 minutes to figure it out the first time. But I had patience and a handy knowledge of positions/tricks to experiment with.
Knowing how to relax your pelvic muscles is a must. I found squatting was the best position, where I could use both my hands to insert it - one to part the labia and the other to put the cup and push it inside (Rim should be facing up)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it’s inside a suction will be created, and I normally walk/run/glide/jump a bit to ensure that it’s firmly in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, it didn’t feel like anything. I have used tampons before and I have been aware of their presence while using them, but this was new, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 4 : Removal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#TMI&lt;/strong&gt;
Of course, the fear of being unable to remove the cup was always there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 hours, when I went to the bathroom to remove the cup, I couldn’t feel the tip/stem of the cup so I was scared, and fully dreading the scenario of going to a hospital to get it removed, even though I knew that’s an unlikely scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:300px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Panik man&quot; title=&quot;Panik man&quot; src=&quot;/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/f93b5/40.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/a80bd/40.jpg 148w,/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/1c91a/40.jpg 295w,/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/f93b5/40.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, of course, I used my pelvic muscles to push it out, until I could feel the tip. Again using two hands here - one was to hold the tip in place so it doesn’t get sucked back in again, the other hand was used to get a finger inside, in between the rim of the cup and the vaginal wall, to break suction. I did this in the shower area, for chances of spillage. I will be honest, it wasn’t the most comfortable experience, but after repeated use I did get a hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you try removing it like a tampon, and yank it out, It will definitely hurt you. Break the seal first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there it was, hardly some 5 mL of menstrual blood. I honestly believed I bled a lot, by looking at the after-state of my sanitary pads, but that’s not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blood was then flushed down the toilet and cleaned with running water, for further use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 5 : Final Wash and Storage&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yay. Periods are over!
I washed it in boiling water on the last day and kept it in a cloth bag, which came along with the cup. It’s important to ensure that this bag is next kept in a clean and dry place, until the next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One also needs to keep in mind to wash their hands with soap before and after using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advantage of using a menstrual cup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/1bd5f41889d0b633c72e894b607ba848/5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Menstrual cup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less landfill waste&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a super eco-friendly menstrual product. One cup can be used for some 10 years which is the equivalent of using 1800 pads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low cost&lt;/em&gt; - The cup that I bought costs INR 300. The pads that I used previously had an average cost of INR 10 per pad. Assuming, the lifetime of the cup is 10 years and not taking into account any external factors, the cup is saving me some INR 11700 (12000-300)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;More time between changes&lt;/em&gt; - Now, this may vary from person to person but the number of times I have to change the cup Vs pad, is on the lower side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super comfy&lt;/em&gt; - It is much more comfortable than pads. I cannot emphasize this enough, I didn’t feel its presence at all. On the bad side, you may actually forget it and leave it inside for a longer time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can work out with it&lt;/em&gt; - I went for a jog, did yoga, did a basic calisthenics workout while using the cup, and it didn’t feel any different. Using pads while exercising was a painful task, because it led to skin bruising on the inner thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feels more hygienic&lt;/em&gt; - Pads always keep touching you, they lead to rashes, abrasions, whatnot. And don’t even get me started on the odor, which keeps reminding you throughout the day that you’re wearing a pad. Cups on the other hand, don’t release any odors because the fluid doesn’t get exposed to the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaches you more about female anatomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t want to read that graphic description? I got you. Adding a FAQ sort-of section below which is more informational&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are menstrual cups safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re super safe. Unless you’re allergic to silicone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does a menstrual cup work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like a tampon, it is inserted into your vagina, but instead of absorbing your flow, like a tampon or pad, it catches and collects it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are they made of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be made of medical-grade silicone, rubber or latex.
They do not contain any chemicals, as compared to pads and tampons, which may contain bleach and dioxin. (Some dioxins can cause cancer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the price of a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can fall in the range of INR 250 - 1000.
It’s cheaper in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What factors should you consider while buying a cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Size - There is no standard sizing chart but brands provide sizes based on flow and cervix position.
Color - Opting for a darker color is my go to thought, since it won’t have that wear-down look after multiple uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to put in a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many folding techniques you can try to find what works for you. Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnK8J8fQxk&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to clean a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm water and mild soap will do the job just right.
Definitely clean out the suction holes, which are present near the rim. They help in releasing the suction, when you need to remove it.
If you want to remove stains, some scrubbing and a vinegar solution will come in handy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to remove a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to do here is relax your muscles and use both hands.
Hold onto the stem of the cup with one hand and use the other hand to insert one finger between the rim and vaginal wall, to let air inside, after which the cup can be pulled outside in the standing position, to avoid leakage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BBC post said that you shouldn’t be pushing your pelvic muscles as it can lead to pelvic organ prolapse, which may happen to people who have a higher cervix, so instead get in a deep squat, breathe with an open mouth and pinch down the base or body of cup to break seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a cup get stuck inside your body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your vaginal canal is actually pretty narrow with a comforting dead end at your cervix. It literally cannot be swallowed up by your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to respond to nature calls with a cup inside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no biggie. The cup is inside the vagina and pee comes out of the urethra - different holes.
Same thing for pooping. There may be some pressure that causes the cup to shift, so a check may be necessary after doing the deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often should you remove it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be left on for upto 12 hours, and works well for heavy flow days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any leakage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not at all.
Definitely look out for the ‘pop’ sound to ensure the cup is sealed well. If not, the cup isn’t fitted perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it painful to insert/remove&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the first few trials are difficult. But practice makes it perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a virgin use the cup / Will it break their hymen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it can. So can a lot of things like riding a bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended list of brands available in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lenacup.com/&quot;&gt;Lena Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shecup.com/&quot;&gt;She Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sironaindia.com/product/menstrual-cup/&quot;&gt;Sirona Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/Boondh-BOONDH-SUNSHINE-YELLOW-MENSTRUAL-CUP/dp/B07GLWST46&quot;&gt;Boondh Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/CUPVERT-Reusable-Menstrual-Women-Medium/dp/B07S6SL8CT&quot;&gt;Cupvert Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is donut economics ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[While in college, they taught me about basic economics, supply-demand, etc. And I have long believed that GDP is a really important factor…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/what-is-donut-economics/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/what-is-donut-economics/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:510px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in college, they taught me about basic economics, supply-demand, etc. And I have long believed that GDP is a really important factor for the economy to function and that it can tell me about the well-being of the people of a nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Circular Flow of Income shows households providing labour and capital to firms, in returns for wages, which they later spend on goods and services, and so it goes round.The unpaid work of carers - particularly housewives - is ignored, no economy can function without them .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This portrayal of the economy as a closed loop of money and resources has been lodged into the brain of every individual, and just like me, hardly anyone questions it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PANDEMIC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am seeing endless debates on news channels and reports about the pandemic’s effect on economies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to shrink by over 3 per cent in 2020 – the steepest slowdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In India, the unemployment rate reached 27.1 per cent in early May, as nearly 122 million Indians lost their jobs between March and April. Experts beleive a significant perecentage of these jobs will not be recovered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of hard to imagine the social and economic effect that is coming our way, it doesn’t look good at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_COVID_19_Risks_Outlook_Special_Edition_Pages.pdf&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Risks Outlook - A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications&lt;/a&gt; raises the alarm bell on a potential vicious future cycle of “continued environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and further zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s definitely tempting to compare current economic projections with the 2008 financial crisis, it’s not going to be the same. The aftermath is going to be more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quote Nobel laureate economist, Joseph E. Stiglitz, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In many ways, it’s far worse than 2008.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s tempting to fall back to old methods and rely on the economist’s traditional toolbox to fix these problems, this may be an opportunity for institutes and think tanks around the world, to make a case for a shift in economic thinking. In the wake of a dire socio-economic crisis, what seems impossible or what was deemed unnecessary a few months back, is now on the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is a &lt;strong&gt;doughnut&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/ed683e65da28294e232890f1c687b670/doh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Homer Simpson with donuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brainchild of Kate Raworth, an English economist working for the University of Oxford, authored the book &lt;strong&gt;“Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist”&lt;/strong&gt; which was a hit and is again gaining quite some eyeballs after the pandemic hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raworth’s bestselling book (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/Doughnut-Economics-Kate-Raworth/dp/1847941389&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) has graced the bedside tables of multiple economists and politicians. It is described as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn as two concentric circles (i.e., donut) explaining the flow between materials and energy, to remind us that we are more than just workers and cash generators/consumers. It’s a graphical representation of the world we should create. The inner ring of the doughnut is inspired by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and represents the minimum things we need to lead a good life –clean water, shelter, gender equality. The outer ring of the doughnut is defined by the ecological limits one oughts to respect to avoid damaging the environment and disrupting the climate. The ‘dough’, therefore, represents the resources we can use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE BOOK&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions present images of the exclusive goal of economy as growth, of economy as a self-contained system and humans as rational, self-interested and dominant over nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talks about market organism, rather than market mechanisms. Wonders if economists would see themselves as gardeners who are stewards rather than believing that things will self-regulate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore the dynamics of a complex organic economic system, that is distributive and regenerative  by design. Regenerative by design gives a way for people to become full participants in regenerating Earth’s life giving cycles so that we thrive within planetary boundaries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonders about an economic design that promotes human prosperity whether GDP is going up, down, or holding steady.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NO CRITICISM?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, of course, there is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free-market economists have criticized Raworth’s theories, stating that her ambitious programs needed to meet social needs and protect the environment are impossible without massive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it fails to give a clear explanantion about the socially-contructed desired minimum levels and the thresholds above which environmnetal problems are likely. These values, especillay the critical natural thresholds (OCean pH, carbon footprint etc.)
Despite its conceptual strength, the doughnut model fails to explain how such a transformation can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SEEING THE DONUT IN ACTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam offers an example of how this may actually work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the strategy, Amsterdam aims to cut food waste by 50 per cent by 2030, from 41 kilos of annual food waste per person today, with the surplus being carried over to residents who need it the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam plans to implement stricter sustainability requirements in construction tenders. For instance, buildings will get a ‘materials passport’ so that demolition companies can determine whether materials are still valuable and/or where reusable materials can be found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The municipality also plans on reducing its own use of new raw materials by 20% and by 2030, only make circular purchases. (What the heck are &lt;a href=&quot;http://circularpp.eu/&quot;&gt;circular purchases&lt;/a&gt;?) This is not just applicable to the procurement of products such as office supplies, computer equipment but also to infrastructure projects such as road-building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam has already started working with businesses and research organisations on over 200 circular economy projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, experts also suggest that this isn’t going to be easy. This strategy is asking the people of Amsterdam to venture out and experiment, accept risk and break old habits, towards a better future, whose benefits may not even be visible in the near future or in the local vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More so, France used it to report on its sustainable development last year, allowing the country to take a look at the interactions between human needs and overall respect for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a poll of 29 countries, 65% of the people said they want their governments to prioritize Climate change during pandemic recovery. Germany is already planning to use stimulus money to build green infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How is medical waste disposed of?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and medical colleges were generating an increasing amount of biomedical waste in an unscientific manner…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-is-medical-waste-disposed-of/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/how-is-medical-waste-disposed-of/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and medical colleges were generating an increasing amount of biomedical waste in an unscientific manner, even before the pandemic hit. Although hospitals protect and save human life, the by-products generated cause great damage to the environment and especially to the people who work closely with this waste. The abysmal waste management practices in these institutions add to the problem and cause exposure to health hazards and environmental problems. The issue of medical waste identification, handling, and disposal needs to have a heightened review so that better management practices and protocols can be established, and necessary efforts should be made to execute them on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, so what is medical waste? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, any waste generated during diagnosis and treatment, which includes contaminated items such as human tissues, body fluids, blood, equipment (beddings, syringes, sharp objects, dressings, etc). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment and disposal of healthcare waste may pose health risks indirectly through the release of pathogens and toxic pollutants into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improper segregation of biomedical waste and different medical waste streams from where they originate can trigger a domino-like effect on the environment which can later become a possible threat to people, animals, or soil and water sources. It has the potential to contaminate groundwater sources, which in turn may enter the ecosystem and then disrupt humans lives too. From hospital waste collection and storage to landfills, biomedical waste needs to be properly contained to keep it away from birds, rodents, and stray animals (as well as humans). This means emphasizing packaging and labelling of contaminants and helps prevent the spread of illness through human and animal populations – by air, land, or water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not properly contained, segregated, incinerated (on site/off site), environmental hazards associated with improper healthcare waste management has the potential to contaminate the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current policies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), released guidelines for handling, treatment and safe disposal of biomedical waste generated during treatment, diagnosis and quarantine of patients confirmed or suspected to have the novel coronavirus disease, during March 2020 itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that waste that can infect people with coronavirus needs to be segregated through color coding; they fall in Red and Yellow categories.
RED bin—used PPE such as goggles, face shield, splash-proof apron, plastic coverall, hazmat suit, gloves, lab equipment like plastic vials, tubes, pipette tips etc.
YELLOW bin—masks (the N95 included), head cover/cap, shoe cover, disposable linen, gown, non-plastic or semi-plastic coveralls, faeces from COVID-19 patient using bed pans or disposable diapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollution watchdog recommends fast disposal of such waste. But do the hospitals actually comply with these rules ? CPCB doesn’t have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:560px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various processes like on-site incineration, steam disinfection, microwave disinfection, autoclave disinfection, and mechanical/chemical disinfection that are currently in use for managing harmful waste in developing countries. Mostly incineration practices are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Bangladesh. Although, hospital waste incinerators operate under sub-optimal conditions and are non-functional due to different reasons. The irony is that the hospital administration emphasizes only the installation of incinerators and often pays attention to its functioning and maintenance. Hospital personnel are reluctant to safely dispose and engage in proper handling of hospital waste, from the director to waste-collector level . So the common methods which are used in developing countries are burning, selling, burial, and dumping to dispose of medical waste. Mostly government hospitals collect their waste in open bins/common places and leave them for 1–2 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preferred method with the least impact on the environment is having it treated by an autoclave. These devises use pressurized air and steam to sterilize the waste and can be used to treat 90% of medical waste. The waste is then shredded, reducing its volume significantly, and taken to a landfill.
There are 199 common bio-medical waste treatment facilities (CBWTFs) in operation and 23 are under construction (CPCB, 2017). However, as per CBWTF operators, setting up such facilities is not economically feasible for considering non-availability of funds for operation, non-compliance with segregation of such wastes at the HCFs level and non-payment of fees by them to the CBWTF personnel. A lenient behaviour is observed in waste segregation by the HCFs which makes using these incinerators, not as productive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various gaps which need to be focused upon. One such is that in most of the hospitals enforcement and monitoring of rules that are in lax. Defaulters (HCFs, CBWTFs) are mostly, either suspended or their contracts are cancelled through District Magistrate (DM) but, are never levied heavily for their non-compliance
HCFs and regulatory authorities have to take stringent measures in order to ensure safe disposal of BMW in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awareness of biomedical waste practices among healthcare professionals is alarmingly unsatisfactory in India. Health care professionals comprising of doctors, nurses, lab technicians and class IV employees were tested and it was found that nurses had more awareness about the proper disposal of waste than other healthcare personnel. Also, Class IV employees had lower knowledge, which is a trend found in most countries around the world. The unsettling thing here is that the study was conducted in Mangalore, a place well-known for superior healthcare facilities, so one wonders how the numbers will be affected if one moves to a medically-poorer region in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact on environment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Water pollution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incineration of biomedical waste contains a high concentration of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and results in unfavourable amounts of hazardous materials and may pollute surface and groundwater. Hence, it is important to eliminate the toxicity of ash before disposal into landfills or reutilization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part about dumping in landfills is the presence of heavy metals from biomedical waste cause a risk to the environment especially in unlined landfills where dissipation of leachate into ground water might occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Air pollution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incinerated materials containing or treated with chlorine can generate dioxins and furans, which are human carcinogens and have been associated with a range of adverse health effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high metal content (in particular lead, mercury and cadmium) can lead to the spread of toxic metals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating medical waste during Covid-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it is early to have exact figures, by some estimates, medical waste generation has increased six-fold compared to pre-COVID-19 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the reports of The South China Morning Post, during the height of the outbreak in Wuhan, the city was dealing with 240 tons of medical waste per day, versus 40 tons prior to that. In the Indian scenario, there is lack of exact data on the subject, but conservative estimates draw a grim picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid outbreak has put India’s unsophisticated garbage treatment system — especially its inadequate handling capacity for biomedical waste—to a massive test. The country has produced nearly 1,700 tonnes of biomedical waste a day between 2016 and 2018, according to Parliament data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger challenge here is: the lack of waste etiquette among the people. There is a alarmingly lack of awareness among the people as well as ground-level garbage collectors. Masks and sanitiser bottles have become a common sight on roads. There have been instances of waste from “containment zones” or inf­ection hotspots getting mixed with those from “safe localities” despite express dir­ections to sanitation staff to separate the two. Besides, as seen in mnay instances, people hardly follow the rules, the standard operating procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society’s perception and practice of ind­iscriminate disposal of items can be a potential source of infection to municipal workers, thus increasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/covid-19-deaths-6-chennai-sanitation-workers-unrecorded-no-solatium-families-127892&quot;&gt;number of deaths among sanitation workers&lt;/a&gt;. People should dispose of used napkins, tissues, empty sanitiser bottles in a separate bag, to ensure the safety of municipal workers and ragpickers and keep it untouched for at least 3 days before disposing them off to ensure garbage collection and plastic recycling doesn’t get affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 15,000 more waste management personnel have a risk of contracting secondary infection every day from the plastic bags filled with used syringes, sharps, catheters, face masks, hazmat suits, and all conceivable clinical garbage. They cover up in overalls, but the risk they take is not covered—no insurance, poor pay, and no acknowledgement either from the government or people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the garbage collected is plastic — N-95 masks are made up of polyisoprene (natural rubber) and polypropylene (thermoplastic); face shields are all plastic. The protocol says used disposable masks, gloves, aprons, head covers and so on should be incinerated or given a burial—at least 100 feet deep. India has over 1,200 registered plastic recyclers. But the PPE suits manufactured in India cannot be recycled. A company owner says: “Polypropylene is used for the kits that are available and cheap.” Recycling of poly materials is high and India currently has no facility for this. Since coveralls are widely used now—from beauty parlours and salons to weddings and hospitals—the question remains where will the waste go?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is sustainable fashion really sustainable ?]]></title><description><![CDATA["How much clean water does it take to make one pair of jeans?" - That is the question that made me delve into the textile industry and the…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/How-does-sustainable-clothing-benefit-the-environment/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/How-does-sustainable-clothing-benefit-the-environment/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“How much clean water does it take to make one pair of jeans?” - That is the question that made me delve into the textile industry and the disastrous effect it has on the environment. I was baffled, I am one of those people who won’t repeat their fancy clothes, after wearing them once. I felt responsible for all the times I had splurged money on discount sales. By the way, the answer to that question is 3,781 litres, from the production of the cotton to the final product. To bring some context, a person needs an average of 20 litres, to take care of basic hygiene and food needs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emergencies/qa/emergencies_qa5/en/&quot;&gt;according to WHO&lt;/a&gt;), which would mean this amount of water could help the water scarcity crisis, and help alleviate the needs of 189 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;RAW MATERIALS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take any item out of your wardrobe and check the materials tag, I bet you will find a significant amount of synthetic materials like Polyester,etc. in it. Let’s go on to a detailed analysis of the major materials found in clothes -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;COTTON
Cotton is the most common natural fibre, used to make clothing which accounts for more than 33% of all fibres that is found in textiles. From the outside, it may seem like anything natural isn’t necessarily bad, but that’s not entirely true. The concerning thing is, cotton is also a very thirsty crop, it requires around 2700 Litres of water - what one person drinks in two and a half years - which is used to make one cotton shirt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s considered even more problematic because it consumes huge quantities of land, pesticides and fertilisers to produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;POLYESTER
Polyester production has a lower environmental impact than natural fibres production in terms of water usage and wastewater. However, the energy required to produce polyester (125 MJ of energy per kilogram produced) and the greenhouse gas emitted (14.2 kg of CO 2 per kilogram produced) make it a high-impact process. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factories who are producing polyester without proper wastewater treatment systems has the potential to release dangerous substances including antimony, cobalt, manganese salts, sodium bromide and titanium dioxide into the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;CELLUSLOSICS
Viscose, lyocell, acetate and modal are all examples of man-made cellulosics. As a plant-based fiber, man-made cellulosics have the potential to be a more sustainable choice because they are renewable.  It’s safe to say that of the man-made cellulosic options, lyocell is considered best in class as it is made in a closed-loop system that recycles most of the solvent used so that no chemicals enter the waste stream. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PROCESSING AND GARMENT PRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,900 chemicals are used in the production of clothing, of which 165 has been classified by EU as hazardous to health or the environment.
The textile industry uses high volumes of water throughout its operational activities, from the washing of fibres to bleaching, dyeing and washing of finished products. On average, approximately 200 litres of water is required to produce l kg of textiles. Moreover, this whole process generates large volumes of wastewater that contains a wide variety of chemicals. The chemicals that cause concern when left in the environment can show subsequent characteristics: durability (not easily degraded), bio-accumulation (collect in living organisms) and poisonousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most of the countries in which garments are produced, untreated toxic-water from textiles factories are dumped directly into the rivers. This wastewater contains toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others, which is obviously extremely harmful for the aquatic life and the health of the millions people living by those rivers banks. Moreover, fish, shellfish and other aquatic creatures ingest the microplastics from these cloth fabrics, which accumulate, concentrating toxins up the food chain. These can enter human food chains and pass into the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of limited transparency in the early value chain and a plethora of different chemicals with varying levels of hazardous impact, it is difficult to choose a proxy that captures impacts ranging from pollution of waterways to the health effects of airborne chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step isn’t very concerning, by only accounting for 2 % of the climate-change impact of the industry, as most large players have optimised the flow of goods. However, this stage is also characterised by waste generated through packaging, tags, hangers and bags, as well as by a large proportion of products that never reach consumers as the unsold leftovers are thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;END OF LIFE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, the end of the line for our garments is limited to charity, which eventually fill up local landfills, where they release methane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, instead of recycling the fabrics and textiles that are over-loading India’s landfills, the country is importing huge quantities of second-hand clothing from countries all over the world. In 2015, India emerged as the world’s largest importer of worn clothing and used textiles. US, UK and Germany were the top 3 exporters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a resort, we look into recycling, but that also faces a number of issues, meaning that globally, only less than one percent of all materials that are used in clothing is recycled back into clothing This reflects a lack of technologies for sorting the collected clothing, separating blended fibres. This is why most clothes are recycled mechanically; they are cut up and shredded, which means that the fibres are shorter, lower quality and lose 75 % of their value. They are therefore not usually used to manufacturing new clothes, but are rather ‘down-cycled’ into insulation material, wiping cloths or mattress stuffing, which is still a better step to ensure minimal wastage. Technologies for chemical recycling that produce virgin fibres of a high quality are available for polyester and nylon and are slowly becoming available, but are not yet fully economically viable, for cotton and blends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, we know that most clothes now are either polyester or part polyester, we are still a long way from ‘closing the loop’ - it’s a pain. The majority of recycled polyester yarn and fabrics comes from recycled plastic – rPET – in particular from plastic bottles. This seems a more environmentally sustainable solution to virgin polyester – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commonobjective.co/article/fibre-briefing-polyester&quot;&gt;it uses between 30 and 50 per cent less energy, reduces the need for primary extraction of crude oil and cuts the amount disposed in landfills&lt;/a&gt;. But then again, each time plastic is reheated for recycling it degrades, so there’s a constraint on recycling it indefinitely (though researchers and start-up businesses are developing some innovative ideas and solutions to this). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The base colour of the plastic chips from the recycled plastic can make dyeing more difficult, so more dye and more water are needed – although inconsistent coloration can still occur.  WHat’s good about polyester also causes problems later on - polyester can be blended with other fibres but it causes problems with recycling. Of all the polyester produced each year, more gets used in poly-cotton blends than in 100 per cent polyester fabric. It is not currently possible to commercially separate poly-cotton and recycle the constituent fibres, although there are some innovative developments in this area. Most poly-cotton fabrics that do enter recycling, rather than just being landfilled, get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oberk.com/packaging-crash-course/downcycling-temp&quot;&gt;‘downcycled’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;THE SOLUTION?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let’s answer - &lt;strong&gt;What does sustainable clothing even mean?&lt;/strong&gt;
This term essentially means that the materials used to make the final clothing is maybe organic, biodegradable, eco-friendly, recycled, upcycled, ethical and/or promotes fair trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to look at this - What can companies do? What can we, as individuals do? What can the government do ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various ways to address these issues have been proposed, including developing new business models for clothing rental and changing consumer behavior that focuses more on recylcing and re-using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow fashion
In the  world of everyone running after tech companies, ‘Fast Fashion’ was the saviour for the retail industry. This was after a long time of witnessing no innovation in the industry. Don’t get me wrong, this is a brilliant concept, but it grew too fast, too soon, without anyone to regulate the companies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side is slow fashion, an attempt to convince consumers to buy fewer clothes of better quality and to keep them for a longer time. The philosophy includes reliance on trusted supply chains, traditional crafting techniques, small-scale production and using local materials. It calls for a change in the economic model, towards selling fewer clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved collection and recycling
Producers and importers can be made legally responsible for ensuring that used clothes are reused or recycled, with companies either organising their own programmes or contributing financially to an accredited collectively responsible organisation. Like H&amp;amp;M runs a voluntary collection scheme to accept used clothes of any brand, regardless of whether they are still usable or not, in their shops in return for a small reward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies or the government can step in and intervene to push companies to take that step. France is the only EU Member State to have an EPR law for clothes, in place since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fashion as a service
Principles of the sharing economy can be used by new business models could increase the number of wears of particular item. Some brands already offer clothes as a service – leasing their clothes instead of selling them – taking their example from already well-established services of renting wedding and special occasion wear, protective clothes and newer services of renting maternity and baby clothes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other businesses operate clothing subscription services, which involves consumers paying a monthly fee to rent a fixed number of garments at a time, enabling them to change their wardrobe frequently without buying new clothes. Ex - Krate, Sugar Box etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sustainable clothing brands&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustainable brands in a way, is a bit of an oxymoron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be sustainable in an actually meaningful way, the best thing to do is buying shop second hand/thrift, repair old clothes, to basically buy only what you need.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don’t disappoint, brands who are ethically sourcing and producing clothes in a way that leads to a decrease in CO2 production, waste, water usage, is still better than most brands (not H&amp;amp;M’s Conscious line, it’s widely accused of greenwashing).  How to make sustainable fashion affordable? Well, you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why is sustainable clothing expensive?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/a16158a67f8ae7eff551ce87baa4ff02/5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;It&amp;#x27;s so expensive GIF&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, but I’ll try to explain this briefly. Two major cost buckets include - cost of fabric and cost of labour. As we have discussed above, if companies want to produce fibres, they have to invest heavily to ensure minimal wastage and reduce pollution, while also ensuring fair wage to their farmers and weavers. (You may have heard about the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Dhaka_garment_factory_collapse&quot;&gt;Rana Plaza factory collapse&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/zara-inditex-workers-still-unpaid-1.4414831&quot;&gt;Zara’s factory working conditions and how it’s workers are under-paid&lt;/a&gt;.

So bigger companies like Zara can pay less for materials - even sustainable ones - because they’re buying in bulk. But ethical brands are usually smaller, and can’t take advantage of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordability is a massive block for accessible sustainable clothing, and if you want lower prices you’re going to need to lower production costs which is what makes fashion so unethical and exploitative in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact: Expensive clothing is not always sustainable, but sustainable clothing is always expensive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a list of sustianable fashion brands in India -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doodlage.in/&quot;&gt;Doodlage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesummerhouse.in/&quot;&gt;The Summer House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wearvenn.com/#&quot;&gt;Venn&lt;/a&gt; (Hella expensive, but they have a thrift store, worth checking out)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ninetypercent.com/&quot;&gt;Ninety Percent&lt;/a&gt; (UK brand, but ships to India)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noolbyhand.com/&quot;&gt;Nool By Hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ka-shaindia.com/&quot;&gt;KaSha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nonasties.in/&quot;&gt;No nasties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anokhi.com/&quot;&gt;Anokhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upasana.in/&quot;&gt;Upasana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pomogrenade.com/&quot;&gt;Pomogrenade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the brands I have mentioned here, religiously engage in recycling and downcycling extensively and/or engage in fair trade practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, find a curated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/aqvexd/2019_master_list_for_ethical_fashion_brands/&quot;&gt;list of brands&lt;/a&gt; created by people around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Compiling this list took a long time, and if I was a consumer looking to buy a product, I think having a specialized, easy-to-use platform will really help me to find and compare ethical fashion brands on the internet -  &lt;/em&gt;Notes down business idea* *)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a personal commitment to only shop for sustainable clothes is not a concession, but rather a way of living your values, creating more individuality and uniqueness in your wardrobe. As more people make the choice to put their money into independent, sustainable, ethical, or secondhand fashion brands rather than fast fashion, the fashion industry’s major players will eventually realize they need to change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pharma Industry - How technology can help in beating the COVID-19 crisis?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since some time, the pharmaceutical supply chain has been struggling to cope.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since some time, the pharmaceutical supply chain has been struggling to cope. Companies rely on China heavily for manufacturing or for sourcing raw materials, and since global trade is suffering with stagnation, so has the pharmaceutical industry, which is also why countries around the world are making this their number 1 priority to manufacture locally, as much as they possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;API dependence on China&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India particularly, where the pharma industry is responsible for supplying over 50% of the global demand for various vaccines. According to a report about the Indian pharma industry, sourcing and procurement of &lt;strong&gt;APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and key starting materials (KSMs)&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial part of the strategic plan to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major portion of the APIs for generic drug manufacturing across the globe are sourced from countries like India and China. To give some context, these 2 nations account for about 80% of the chemicals used to make drugs sold in Europe. And the glaring problem that arose was the fact that, Indian manufacturers rely heavily on APIs from China for the production of their medicine formulations, procuring around 70 percent from China, who is the top global producer and exporter of APIs, by volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak, exposed the dependency of the pharma sector on China for its API procurement. The disrupted supply chain along with the increased restrictions on exports due to manpower shortages in China’s manufacturing plants, had a devastating effect. Supplies were impacted by the disruption of logistic and transportation systems, restricting access and movement of products to and from ports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1991, the Indian pharmaceutical industry only imported 0.3% of its API requirements from China; then globalisation came into picture which led to a rise in large-scale formulation manufacturing prompted the increase in API procurement from China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary driver towards this choice was the &lt;strong&gt;low cost of production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Indian pharma and medical manufacturing firms have taken a hit and have fallen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/pharma-companies-capacity-utilisation-stood-at-50-60-till-may-17-report-5281371.html&quot;&gt;50-60% of their capacity&lt;/a&gt;, transport and shipping, and a labour shortage as migrant workers returned to their villages for lockdown, shipment costs increased two folds for cargo containers and around 4 times more for air freights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts from the pharmaceutical industry and NITI Aayog suggested that &lt;strong&gt;fostering the approvals of pharmaceutical infrastructure development, obtaining clearance from the environment department to convert brownfield units, alongwith a separate financial scheme and providing tax exemptions and subsidies&lt;/strong&gt; for the development and promotion of the pharmaceutical industry hubs could all be beneficial in tackling this crisis. The govt. announced production linked incentive (PLI) schemes to incentivise the production of APIs, but it is just not possible for every company to get benefited as there are various provisions which will be taken into consideration on priority, like, companies involved in backward integration, new age technology adoption etc. The government wants companies to innovate and adopt new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technologies that will help companies fight the pandemic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using digital technologies for quality control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing advanced analytics and automation for quality control, can reduce manual errors and improve quality, thus increasing productivity by 30-40%, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/pharmaceuticals-and-medical-products/our-insights/digitization-automation-and-online-testing-the-future-of-pharma-quality-control&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharma companies sit on a wealth of data, usually locked away in different technical and organizational silos. Some are already linking and mining their data sets to improve their pipelines, products, and strategies, but there still remains a huge opportunity to create further value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great example of this digital transformation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expresscomputer.in/industries/pharma/how-cipla-is-embedding-digital-into-its-business-planning-and-execution/35007/&quot;&gt;Cipla’s API manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; in Kurukambh, India, which has fully embraced the power of digital technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes using real time data and tools like advanced analytics to identify KPIs, which then provides insights, for making strategic decisions. Use of digital information management systems, is helping in automating material flow and accurately capture cost-information with a paperless workflow. Moreover, they are also embracing the use of augmented reality and virtual reality technologies for employee training and plant maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing IT services to boost manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry has the reputation of being cautious about implementing new technology and slow to make changes. This conservatism is more or less due to regulatory requirements, to prove that any process modifications will not have a detrimental effect on product quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Information-Technology-Investments-and-Export-of-A-Bhat/b51a4d25798001368685103f5a0d19e20a8c2e2b&quot;&gt;investing in IT&lt;/a&gt; can, for example, boost the export performance of pharma firms. For Indian pharma firms that invest in building digital capabilities, exports make up 45% of sales, on average. For those that are digital followers rather than digital leaders, and invest less in new technology, exports make up only 28% of sales, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation in manufacturing can help raise productivity and output, which will positively help in boosting exports. Digital platforms can provide better access to new markets through online sales channels and digital marketing. Plus, digital inventory management can further use valuable customer data in business models and can strengthen customer relationships through direct and quick communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in Research &amp;amp; Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While observing the patenting activity in the pharma sector, it’s clear that India accounts for less than 2% of global pharmaceutical patents, significantly lower than China (at 8.75%), the U.S. (at 40% ) and the EU (at 22%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in this area could be driven by a renewed appetite for business-risks, and a better approach to the research and development environment. Seeking uniformity between products produced in different states will be a helpful step, plus a step taken in  reskilling the India pharma workforce through new work incentives, training and resources will be fruitful. Being able to intelligently search vast data sets of patents, scientific publications, and clinical trials data should, in theory, help accelerate the discovery of new drugs by enabling researchers to examine previous results of tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A noteworthy example to look into is -  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qlik.com/us/company/press-room/press-releases/1206-lupin-pharmaceuticals-prescribes-qlik-for-healthier-decision-making&quot;&gt;Lupin&lt;/a&gt;, which is now using data science and analytics almost everywhere, including research and development, sales, finance, IT, manufacturing, quality and human resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has &lt;a href=&quot;https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/strategy-and-management/covid-19-will-increase-digitisation-in-pharma-firms-lupin-cio/76417037&quot;&gt;accelerated its adoption of digitalization&lt;/a&gt;, with the firm now digitizing access control systems through facial recognition and temperature measurements, while also using an online medium for training its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms need to invest in digital innovation to make services more personalized, physicians and patients more engaged, decisions more data driven and business practices more immediate. The industry and government leaders have to work hand-in-hand actively to maximize productivity gains and create employment opportunities to overcome the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 crisis. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telehealth services are on the rise]]></title><description><![CDATA[The demand for triaging technologies, like conversational bots, has risen substantially as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, which isn’t…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/healthcare-transformation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/healthcare-transformation/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand for triaging technologies, like conversational bots, has risen substantially as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, which isn’t surprising. Tech giants like IBM, Facebook, and Microsoft have engaged in  partnerships with governments and private industry to roll out chatbot-based solutions, as have a number of startups.  For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/gyant-raises-13-6m-series-a-from-wing-venture-capital/&quot;&gt;Gyant&lt;/a&gt;, whose AI-enabled health platform is designed to drive patient-doctor engagement, closed a $13.6 million round recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, startups such as Practo, DocPrime and Lybrate were operating under a regulatory grey area. Unlike US, doctors in India are allowed to practice in any state. So it was always legal to practice telemedicine, but the regulations were never formalised. &lt;strong&gt;The Govt. Of India introduced a new comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Telemedicine.pdf&quot;&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; on how to practice telehealth&lt;/strong&gt; in March, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just imagine - a service that is as old as the telephone, is making a comeback - &lt;strong&gt;Telehealth&lt;/strong&gt;. What cannot be ignored is, we may also look back on this challenging time as the moment when healthcare transformed to become more preventive, with a focus on health and care, keeping everyone in the community healthy and doing so more efficiently and cost-effectively.  Paperwork, payment, and other administrative burdens can be remotely automated by digital health services platforms, which will also, in turn help in lowering costs. Although this accelerated adoption, largely driven by the pandemic, is far from perfect, we’ve learned that much of our care can be delivered virtually. &lt;strong&gt;Healthcare is the most information intensive industry, yet it uses very less amount if IT or new technologies&lt;/strong&gt;, for some weird reason. Many ailments can be treated without physically going into a doctor’s office like back pain, headache, psychiatry, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know, other diseases haven taken a backseat as majorly all resources are going into treating Covid-19 patients. It’s troubling to even imagine how many childhood vaccinations that didn’t happen, screenings for cancer and other illnesses that didn’t happen. These services require movement to happen and only pre-planning and innovation can help when the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, we also learned that it’s often healthier, both for the patient and the physician, to keep those who are sick and those who are vulnerable to health complications, at home, rather than coming to the doctor’s office, the ER, or the hospital. Paired with the fact that the single largest reason people do not access have to adequate healthcare, whether in urban settings or in rural ones, is transportation, virtual care is ideal. It’s still unsure how these consultations will be charged, because as per the guidelines, they should be charged just as a normal consultation is, but as per my discussion with certain healthcare providers during last week, they simply don’t have any idea about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive care is not incentivised so no one cares about it, it’s only when procedures are being done, that can help you earn money. Length of stay in a hospital is the first metric to look for if you’re judging a hospital’s efficiency; it costs more for the hospital to take care of a person, so they would want it to be as low as possible. So to reduce spending in medical care, it’s important to get people out of institutions. &lt;strong&gt;More preventive care with cheap and innovative inventions will help keep people out of institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing virtual solutions with more comprehensive at-home diagnostics and lab testing will free up our health and care system to focus more intently on what is most critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orthopaedic surgery in severe bleeding disorders: A low-volume, high-cost procedure - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last week, I found myself buying health insurance for myself. My new job would have covered me, but that is out the window, and so is the possibility to get covered under company insurance(Thanks to the pandemic). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, I will explain my process I used to come to my choice. You can find plenty of websites explaining how to choose a health insurance, and some of the pointers I mention below may be repeated, but bear with me in the interest of making this comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all answer this question - &lt;strong&gt;Who are you getting a health insurance for?&lt;/strong&gt;
People around me told me that the general thumb rule is - Insurance premium should be 6 times your salary. (You should also consider other factors like your age, dependents, current illnesses etc.). I was only looking for insurance for myself, if more members in my family weren’t covered, then there would be another decision making step here - whether to choose a family floater plan (calculated by using the age of the eldest member in the plan, to calculate premium) or individual plans for each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary factors to consider include the following, if you just want to get a basic idea about the insurance you’re choosing-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cashless hospitalisation&lt;/strong&gt; (Medical treatment done without paying the bills yourself)
Normally, if you get a treatment done the amount will be paid out of your pocket and will be reimbursed later on by the insurance company. Not everyone has that much liquid cash lying around, so now more and more people are actively looking for hospitals which their insurance company can directly cover. See if the best hospitals in your area, are in the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-patient hospitalisation coverage&lt;/strong&gt; (When you stay at the hospital for medication/treatment for more than 24 hours)
Most insurance companies provide a 100% coverage, but there are exceptions. Always choose one which has maximum coverage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coverage for day-care treatment&lt;/strong&gt; (Procedures that are completed in 24 hours)
It’s self-explanatory, the higher it is the better. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Room rent allowance&lt;/strong&gt;
Some plans have no capping on room rent, some allow a certain percentage. Try to find what is the maximum allowance is for a hospital room nearby.
It’s really peculiar to me why almost no one discloses this information beforehand, because it can vary a lot. I went through old hospital bills of times when my parents were admitted to a hospital, in my city, and I couldn’t get a quote for government hospitals, but in the private hospitals, the charge averaged around INR 2000, and that also involved around a multitde of factors, including food, cleaning charges, television, medications etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre and post hospitalisation expenses&lt;/strong&gt; (Reimbursement of expenses prior to hospitalisation &amp;amp; post discharge costs)
It is typically 30 days before hospitalisation and 60 days after hospitalisation. Though some plans put limitations on coverage amount, so it’s better talk to the customer service to get clarification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub limits for certain expenses/treatment&lt;/strong&gt; (cap of how much a policyholder can claim for a particular expense)
Particularly - Cataract surgery may have sub limit per eye, maternity (Normal delivery and Casearean delivery costs differ)
Whatever I found, it’s mostly ailments that effects the elderly, something that doesn’t concern me. I skimmed through the document but I will advice reading the fine print in the policy document.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors to consider -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting period&lt;/strong&gt; - Only if you have pre-existing illness. The lower it is the better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-payment&lt;/strong&gt; - Share of claim you need to pay from your own pocket. Mostly seen in senior citizens or specific need plans. No co-pay means that, in theory, you pay nothing and the insurance covers all costs. I say ‘in theory’ because some costs might not be covered by your plan and you might have to pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt; - These treatments are not covered by health plan. Typically, include Dental, Eye care (unless you were hospitalised) etc. You should be aware of this, so I’m restating this, DO READ THE POLICY DOCUMENT or get clarification from the company. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eecdb0568aa1ae072db2d42ac0fecf5d/tenor.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Homer Simpson struggling to read a long book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits to enhance Sum assured -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No claim bonus&lt;/strong&gt; - Insurance companies increase amount of sum assured by some percentage for the next year, if the insurance amount is not claimed for 1 year, 2 years, etc. This is not a must-have but a nice-to-have feature given high medical inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration for additional coverage&lt;/strong&gt; - In case you spend the entire sum assured, the insurer would add more coverage without taking additional premium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this criteria, I went on to check plans on policybazaar.com and started screening them. And from the list of options, I also checked the LiveMint Mediclaim Ratings for the past few years, just to see how my choices were performing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/static/mediclaim-rating-2019&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/mintmediratings2018&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/Object/1XhvIv1t7ce1r1WiQ4BoyJ/mediclaimrating-2017.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally decided with HDFC Ergo (formerly known as Apollo Munich). They were consistently in the top ranks, and were more suitable to my needs, with more number of cashless hospitals in my areas than any other company. The only con here is maybe they charge a lot more than most insurers, however I have some reviews that tell me the reimbursement procedure is hassle-free and comparatively faster, and that is worth the extra amount.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advertisers Vs Facebook]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the past few days, there has been a rise in the number of companies boycotting Facebook as a platform for advertising.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, there has been a rise in the number of companies boycotting Facebook as a platform for advertising. Last I checked, more than 800 companies have pulled out their money from Facebook. It started out initially as a #StopHateForProfit campaign, to call out Facebook to up its game on content moderation, after Facebook didn’t take any action on the post by President Trump stating “… When the looting starts, the shooting starts”, which many people thought provoked violence. (It does, it felt like a dog whistle). And then many small companies, who are relatively active in social issues, jumped in on the #BoycottFacebook movement.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the boycott came quickly, the relationship between advertisers and Facebook has been stressful since a couple of years, and it was just a matter of opportunistic time for advertisers to take a strong stand on the matter, because most of all, every company wants to keep its brand safe and away from hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the advent of new technologies and digital platforms, the world of advertising has changed. Platforms like Facebook, have given advertisers the opportunity to connect with the right audience and not go by the old let’s-see-what-sticks method, and spend millions for a widescale advertising campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also brought along a number of problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a challenge for advertisers to actually know how many people were even seeing their ads or to know what their ads were appearing next to. Facebook disclosed in 2016 that they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/11/16/technology/facebook-ad-metrics/index.html&quot;&gt;overestimated how long people actually spent watching ads on their platform&lt;/a&gt;. The number was &lt;strong&gt;off by around 80%&lt;/strong&gt;, which was a real blow to all the advertisers, because from the outside it looked like a really powerful platform with plenty of data to work with, but after this disclosure, it became difficult to trust it, and FB was pushed to start auditing their media metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, YouTube faced a similar issue, when brands realised that their ads were being played before objectionable videos, and many complained like P&amp;amp;G, AT&amp;amp;T etc. and started a boycott and stopped spending money on the platform immediately. And it pushed Google to hire more people to moderate content, spend more on AI to weed out “bad videos” and gave brands more power to decide where their ads would appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue here is - AI is still developing, and will need time to perfect itself. And even if companies try and hire a bunch load of people to moderate content, it would take an enormous amount of investment of time, labor and money to actually do it. So this is a real headscratcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether Facebook will really be dented, either financially or as a brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional links: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean&quot;&gt;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[le idiot box, le idiot me]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's been 9 years and I just realized this recently, that throughout this period I have always been hooked onto some Tv show; I felt a void…]]></description><link>https://shwetadas.me/blog/tv-and-me/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://shwetadas.me/blog/tv-and-me/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:400px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been 9 years and I just realized this recently, that throughout this period I have always been hooked onto some Tv show; I felt a void in my life when I wasn’t watching a show. It becomes absolutely necessary for me to start a new series as soon as I’m done with one. I need something to watch when I am having my meals and it just feels strange to eat my food in complete silence, without any distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how Tv isn’t good for you right? Right. But we’re humans and we all share one distinct mental flaw (actually many but let’s focus on one for now). It’s in our habit to utilize our money’s worth on objects/services that we pay for. And that’s why when I am paying ₹200/month for a Netflix subscription I want to consume as much content as I can. I’m completely genre-agnostic and I have watched shows ranging from &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt; and even filth like &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt;. I started watching Tv shows actively in 2011 after I was introduced to a funny show called F.R.I.E.N.D.S. And because they had a duration of 20-minutes, I slowly increased the frequency of episodes I could watch at a go. There was a time when I would just play an episode on my laptop and do my work because I liked the background noise. In the time it’s taken me to write this blog, I’ve already dived into several episodes of The IT crowd. (Brilliant show, btw. British humor at its best)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried replacing these series with podcasts but haven’t been successful (yet). The worst thing is, I was an avid reader before all of this, now I can only read short stories because my attention span has decreased and of course there are certain other factors that caused this change, I’m sure the availability of a plethora of creative content just a button away, plays an important role here. With the advent of Amazon Prime, Hotstar and the Holy Grail of instant TV, Netflix, television has never been more accessible, which is wonderful for our instant-gratification-generation minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/a0f46e5965b5d45ab49daed26a33cd67/IG.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cat pressing button animation&amp;quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online TV not only changes the way we consume TV, but also influences the television-viewing experience. In the good old days, if you watch one episode of your favorite show on a Friday, you would have to wait until the next Friday to resume the series, giving you ample amount of time to come act and act as a productive member of society. But if you log on to Netflix and hit play on that first pilot episode of any show, there is nothing stopping you from passively allowing the next episode to automatically play until you’re unsure what day it is. Now I can pick what I want to watch and become absorbed in it, with no commercials to jolt me back to reality or obligations. It is both convenient to know that I can watch TV when it suits me and tempting to waste inordinate amounts of time that should be rather spent of reading papers or learning new skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many people follow the same routine. A routine that has led me to watch some 70 odd Tv series till date. And it’s not like I do it casually, I remember every one of those episodes, for some, I even remember the dialogues by heart (Its nerve wrecking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no silver lining here, except for the fact that I mostly learnt English by watching these shows.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vaccine development for COVID-19]]></title><description><![CDATA[I will go out on a limb and state here that the Covid-19 pandemic is the most defining aeon of our lifetime.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will go out on a limb and state here that the Covid-19 pandemic is the most defining aeon of our lifetime. Every other concern has become secondary, the primary focus right now is to find a cure for the Covid-19 virus. Research for treating the coronavirus, is being done in record time. New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported in February, that it was getting upto 20 submissions each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did my bachelors in the field of Biotechnology, and in my first class on genetic engineering, we learnt about vaccine development and how it takes years to develop a vaccine (on an average, 10 years). But we don’t have that kind of time now, and companies have been working on overdrive to generate a vaccine for the coronavirus.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you some context, the following is the time involved in clinical trials -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before all of this, months are spent on lab and animal testing. And, some companies are already in Phase 2, which speaks about the fast progress in vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How do vaccines work?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two basic types of vaccines - Live attenuated and inactivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live attenuated vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; are produced by modifying the virus in the laboratory, such that it can replicate itself but won’t cause any illness.(Ex- Measles, Yellow fever etc.). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactivate vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;, as the name suggests, are produced by creating the virus I culture media, then inactivating it with heat and/or chemicals, so that it wouldn’t replicate. In contrast with live vaccines, that almost resemble a natural infection, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;antibody titers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (a measure of amount of antibodies, specifically neutralizing antibodies; used to check if a vaccine is working) against inactivated antigens diminish with time, so multiple doses or ”&lt;em&gt;boosts&lt;/em&gt;” may be required. (Ex- Polio, Rabies, Hep A etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratories around the world are now working to create these different kinds of vaccines, but all of them have one goal, to train the immune system to recognize and combat the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential entity that is going to help develop the vaccine is - &lt;em&gt;the spikes&lt;/em&gt;; these spikes are the genetic material that will be identified by our immune system so that it can fight it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, is developing it’s mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, where  the goal is to, inject the ”&lt;em&gt;spike&lt;/em&gt;“(mRNA) into our body which will translate it into a protein, which our immune system will identify and then exterminate (which is pretty cool, tbh). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just started its clinical trials, last Friday, with its booster shots. Some companies are even trying to inject the mRNA inside our body by using a totally different, harmless virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a vaccine for the coronavirus ?
Not yet. (So the best chances for your survival is wearing &lt;strong&gt;the god damn mask&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing is, people around the world are working to make it a reality soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;When will the vaccine be ready?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Fauci, gave us all hope that the vaccine may be ready by early 2021. According to the latest update, WHO stated recently that &lt;strong&gt;10 out of the 120 vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; being developed globally are already in human trials. Looking at how fast China is working on a promising development and the fact that it has already published an article in the peer-reviewed medical journal, The Lancelet, about the first in-human clinical trials, we may even have it sooner, but there are some serious concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had contracted the coronavirus and then recovered, had a antibody titer count of at least a 100, so it’s safe to say that &lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt; should ideally be a antibody titer target for any vaccine. In the case of the Chinese vaccine study mentioned earlier, out of the three doses administered to the odd 100 volunteers, the highest dose averaged around a count of 34, which is way less. Moreover, 81% of the participants developed at least one adverse reaction within the first seven days of vaccination, so there’s still a big question mark on the safety of these vaccines. Similarly, Moderna reported 3 out of its 45 participants, experiencing severe but non-threatening symptoms, all of these 3 participants were given the high dose. During these kind of experimental vaccines, side-effects are pretty common, and with further trials, the dosage is decreased gradually until they find the ideal amount, that has less or negligible reactions and is also able to do its job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Is it possible to make enough of this vaccine for everyone?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To actually create a traditional vaccine, it’s essential that you have cells where you can grow them. You put the weakened virus into the cells, create a good environment for them in a bio-reactor and feed it with nutrients, so that it grows well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE CELLS = MORE VACCINES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of this takes months to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this, the mRNA vaccines can be a game-changer, because you won’t be spending time growing the cells, essentially creating multiple doses. The slight issue here being, this has never been done before, so some problems may pop up, but experts agree that producing mRNA in mass quantities is a likely possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, even if we actually get a promising vaccine, there’s still something companies are really worried about, that may sound trivial - &lt;em&gt;where to put the vaccines?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are stored in &lt;strong&gt;small vials with stoppers&lt;/strong&gt;, that are extremely sterile, and are produced in places that are 100 times cleaner than a hospital. And even though these guys have ramped up all the steps for vaccine production, the real constraint here is to ramp up the production of these tubes, in quality conditions, while also figuring out methods to minimize the delay causing factors, like packaging. Many public-health experts and pharmaceutical leaders have stated publicly that they are worried about a potential glass-vial supply squeeze, due to the pandemic. Of course, rolling out billions of vaccine at record speed is no easy task, and it’s necessary to think and plan of solutions for possible problems that may need to be sorted out. For which, it’s essential to look at the supply chain from the &lt;em&gt;start to the end&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with producing medical glass equipment is that it’s supply chain is traditionally fixed, and slow-growing, which means that it is also prone to shortages, such as this one. It only produces on a need-basis, so it doesn’t have surge capacity to cater to emergency situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This glass market is inclined towards fragmentation. The surge in government initiatives and increasing demand for injectables and other medicines provide lucrative opportunities in the glass packaging solutions in the pharmaceutical industry. Competitive rivalry is high and the expansion and mergers of large companies in different pharmaceutical industries are expected to increase the demand in the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But a medical glass shortage was already setting in before the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/strong&gt;  Procuring raw material is an issue, since sand found alongside riversides is needed, which is different and coarse than the fine, desert sand, which has suffered a setback due to increase in environmental regulations. And even after obtaining these materials, normal glass factories have to undergo significant changes to ramp up vial production. A beverage glass maker cannot simply start producing medical glass equipment. In India itself, it has been difficult, logistically, for bottles and vials makers to provide to pharma companies. For instance, AGI glaspac’s pharma segment, which currently contributes 30-32 % of glass packaging in the Indian pharma packaging industry, is facing hampered production, affected supplies, and increased stock. So far, the company is working partially with limited raw materials like sand and soda ash, the key input raw materials for glass packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rick Bright, formerly the head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), alleges he warned of a looming global shortage of glass vials but administration officials did not heed his advice. He wrote that major glass producers have warned that a particular material, borosilicate tubing, is sold out and it could take up to two years to meet the U.S. vaccine need alone .Even after the first batch of vaccines have been sourced and the shortages managed, coronavirus vaccines may have to be followed up every few years, meaning the strain on the supply chain could reappear in just a few years time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe for the first time in world history, companies like Pfizer and Moderna are planning to start manufacturing vaccines on a large scale, while still being in the trial phase, just so that they can cope with the demand when the vaccine is finally approved.
Some manufacturers are already preparing for this potential crunch: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; is exploring both single-use vials and those that can hold multiple vaccine doses, according to its regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shortage of vials could interfere not just with the availability of a coronavirus vaccine but a range of other medicines, including sedatives and other drugs administered in hospitals. It’s strange, in the end, everything boils down to &lt;strong&gt;LOGISTICS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;All of these research and scientific articles is freely available, after 94 academic journals, societies, institutes and companies signed a commitment to do so. It’s open to the public, if anyone’s interested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sustainable sex - Environmental impact of used condoms]]></title><description><![CDATA[It was a regular Sunday for me.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a regular Sunday for me. I was having breakfast and watching a documentary on Sony BBC called “Extreme Engineering”, when suddenly a question popped in my head “What happens to used condoms after they are thrown in trash?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little context, I gave myself only one goal for 2020, to practice sustainable living by investigating and implementing low-waste alternatives into my lifestyle. Now we know plastic is bad, god knows how many times I have found cows on the street, all bloated and dead, after eating plastic. It’s toxic and it’s killing us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress enough about how important condoms are for some people, it’s the most cost-effective, easily available birth control method on the market, and the only way to prevent STIs/STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should definitely be using a condom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the only question remains, what happens to it afterwards? After it’s thrown in the garbage and collected by the garbage truck?z&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some extensive research, I tried to calculate a number to estimate the number of condoms that are being used in a day. It’s about - &lt;strong&gt;19.8 million&lt;/strong&gt;. And that’s a pretty huge number, when you take into account that 39600kgs of waste generated every day will last in the world for some hundreds of years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WHAT ARE CONDOMS MADE OF?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Condom companies are rarely transparent about their ingredients. They use non-visible additives and chemicals, even in ‘natural latex’ condoms’, which are rarely 100% natural and thus will not decompose for a long time. But for the sake of being optimistic, latex condoms can be broken down for the most part, polyurethane condoms just can’t. And definitely not if it’s coated with lubricant or spermicide or if it hits the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There just isn’t any study to tell us exactly how much time it takes for a condom- lubricated or not- to break down, plus there aren’t enough experimental studies done with condoms for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CURRENT SCENARIO&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report by the UN, tells me there are 3 primary ways how condoms are disposed off - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;General landfill &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specific burial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incineration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with disposing waste in the ground, other than the risk of scavenging, is that the plastics enter the water cycle and we end up with microplastics inside us. And I am no genius, but that cannot possibly be good for our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the option of burning. The major materials (Rubber, Polyethylene, Hydrocarbons, Silicone) in condoms and their packs are combustible and have a high fuel value. So it is actually an energy-efficient means of disposal if the energy of combustion can be recovered (like using it for electricity production). High temperature incinerators are also used for destroying hazardous medical waste, and may be available for condom destruction. However, it is likely that such incinerators would have a relatively low capacity. (Some good news, finally. But have to check the feasibility for doing so.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;SO WHAT CAN I DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well,  a quick search on Google will tell you how to dispose off condoms in the trash and NOT throw it in the recycling bin or flush it down the toilet, or worse, reuse it. UGH. Governments, NGOs, corporations, social marketing organizations have told people to use condoms, but no one ever tells on how to properly dispose them, even though they have the potential to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fret not, fellow nature lover, being sexually active and sustainable is an option now. There are people who are working everyday to find an eco-friendly way to degrade condoms, in a controlled environment, without affecting the environment. New companies have come up that are now manufacturing eco-friendly condoms -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greencondom.club/green-condoms&quot;&gt;Green Condom Club&lt;/a&gt;
They do not contain any toxic chemicals and clearly list the ingredients used for manufacturing, as well as being produced and tested according to the strictest CE and ISO norms to be safe and reliable!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairsquared.info/fairtrade-products-en/condoms-en/&quot;&gt;Fair Squared&lt;/a&gt;
The condoms are made from natural latex and fairtrade rubber, ethically farmed in South India, where the company aim to improve the working and living conditions of the primary producers in Kerala. They are certified with a CE mark and tested to the highest possible International standard ISO 4074&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sustainnatural.com/products/condoms&quot;&gt;Sustain Natural&lt;/a&gt;
The Fair Trade rubber is made in a solar-powered factory in a plantation in India, where they pay their workers fair wages and treat them with respect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN FACT&lt;/strong&gt; : A study shows that going childless is a better way help the environment than recycling or driving an energy-efficient car, it’s 20 times more effective, to be exact. So in some ways, condoms are actually good for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you know of some sources that I should read, please do reach out to me on Twitter or email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for indulging me in my exploration of whether condoms can be recycled!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to get customer insight without doing surveys]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the first class of Marketing 101, I learnt that customer insight is the core of any product/service you wish to sell.

As a marketing student, my projects mostly involved doing surveys and focus group discussions and although not being a master at market research I did learn the basics of it. Although, there were many times I just couldn’t find that niche group of people who I wanted to study nor did I have money lying around to pay someone to do it for me, I had to rely on other publicly available resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three things really helped me to get some external input - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social media &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research reports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web Tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt;SOCIAL MEDIA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of websites where people go to share their feedbacks or raise complaints about products. Social media has given people a chance to express themselves, build communities, interact and involve with the communications giving scope to more engagement between people. This is a gold mine of information, that’s waiting to be harnessed. This can be done in two steps - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1. Text scraping &lt;/strong&gt; - Can be done using a tool webscraper.io, which has a chrome/firefox extension to extract specific data from websites. The tool allows the user to build Site Maps from different types of selectors. Creating a sitemap and selectors tells the system what to do during the scraping process so that data can be extracted.&lt;strong&gt; 2. Text mining and visualization &lt;/strong&gt; - The data can be cleaned later on in Excel by removing irrelevant data and segregating it. This data can be further visualized using a tool called VOSviewer to find the most occuring words and identify the broad theme of words/relation between them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popular sites where people provide feedback - Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;RESEARCH REPORTS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has access to industrial reports from Gartner etc. One can still find multitude of reports on the internet to understand customer behaviour, although it takes a considerable amount of time to research and find the relevant ones.
Some sites that I have found useful include - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1. Think with Google &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2. Nielsen Reports &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 3. Revuze blog &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 4. Research papers of educuational institutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WEB TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a huge chunk of your customer base has access to internet, it’s imperative to look into their search history. There are sites like AnswerThePublic (my personal favorite, see image below), which can tell you what people are searching for on the internet, by using search data from sites like Google and Bing. What stands out is the interface and the fact that it can shed out some cool infographics for easy visualization. It seriously is an underrated website, and can be useful for many, like if you want ideas for creating content for your Instagram handle or if you want to target the best SEO keywords.
